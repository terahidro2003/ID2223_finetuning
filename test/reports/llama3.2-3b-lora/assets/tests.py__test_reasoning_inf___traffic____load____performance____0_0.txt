To identify the bottleneck, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The website loads slowly only during business hours, which suggests that the issue is related to the time of day or the volume of traffic.
2. Business hours typically occur during the morning and afternoon, when more people are likely to be using the website.
3. This could indicate that the website is experiencing high traffic or a large number of concurrent users during these times.
4. High traffic can put a strain on the website's infrastructure, including its servers, network, and database.
5. A bottleneck in this case could be the website's ability to handle the increased traffic, which might be caused by:
	* Insufficient server resources (e.g., CPU, memory, or storage)
	* Network congestion or slow bandwidth
	* Database queries or data retrieval issues
	* Inadequate caching or content delivery network (CDN) configuration
	* High demand for bandwidth or resources during peak hours

To further investigate, it would be helpful to:

* Monitor server resources, network traffic, and database queries during peak hours
* Analyze website logs and traffic patterns to identify any trends or bottlenecks
* Review the website's infrastructure and configuration to ensure it is optimized for high traffic
* Consider implementing measures to reduce traffic or optimize resource allocation during peak hours

Final Answer: The bottleneck could be the website's inability to handle the increased traffic during business hours, likely due to insufficient server resources or network congestion.
