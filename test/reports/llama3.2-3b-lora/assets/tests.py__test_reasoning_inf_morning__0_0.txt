There are several possible reasons why the coffee shop might have a long line at 8 AM on Monday but be nearly empty at 2 PM:

1. **Lunch Rush**: Many people take a break from work to grab lunch, and coffee shops are often a popular spot for this. The line at 8 AM might be filled with people waiting to grab a quick lunch, but by 2 PM, the lunch rush has ended, and the shop is empty.

2. **Monday Morning Routine**: Mondays are often a busy day for people, and many have a morning routine that involves grabbing a coffee before starting their workday. The line at 8 AM might be filled with people who are part of this morning routine, but by 2 PM, the morning rush has subsided.

3. **Commuter Traffic**: If the coffee shop is located near a busy office building or a major transportation hub, it might be a popular spot for commuters who need a quick coffee before or after work. The line at 8 AM might be filled with people who are commuting to work, but by 2 PM, the office workers have left for the day.

4. **Afternoon Slump**: Some people might experience a mid-day slump, where they need a caffeine boost to get through the rest of the day. The line at 8 AM might be filled with people who are trying to get a head start on their day, but by 2 PM, the afternoon slump has set in, and people are looking for a pick-me-up.

5. **Special Events or Meetings**: It's possible that the coffee shop is hosting a special event or meeting at 8 AM, which is attracting a large crowd. However, by 2 PM, the event or meeting might have ended, and the shop is empty.

These are just a few possible explanations for why the coffee shop might have a long line at 8 AM but be nearly empty at 2 PM.
