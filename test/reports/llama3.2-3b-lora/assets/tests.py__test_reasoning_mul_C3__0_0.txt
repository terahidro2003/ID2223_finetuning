To find the square root of 144, we need to determine the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 144.

First, let's recall that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In mathematical terms, if we have a number x, then its square root is denoted by √x, and it satisfies the equation x = (√x)².

Now, let's consider the options given:

A) 10
B) 11
C) 12
D) 13

We can quickly eliminate options A and B, as 10² = 100 and 11² = 121, which are both less than 144.

Next, let's consider options C and D. We can calculate 12² = 144, which matches the given number.

Therefore, the square root of 144 is 12.

Final Answer: 12
