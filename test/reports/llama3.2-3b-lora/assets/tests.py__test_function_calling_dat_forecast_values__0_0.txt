Here's an example of how you can use the `forecast_values` function to forecast the next 6 periods for the `stock_prices` series using an ARIMA model:

```json
{
  "function": "forecast_values",
  "series": "stock_prices",
  "periods": 6,
  "model": "ARIMA(1,1,1)"
}
```

In this example, we're using an ARIMA model with 1 autoregressive term, 1 differencing term, and 1 moving average term. The `(1,1,1)` part of the string specifies these parameters. You can adjust these parameters to suit your specific needs.

Please note that the `forecast_values` function returns a list of forecasted values, where each value is the forecast for a specific period. In this case, the function will return a list of 6 values, each representing the forecast for the next period.

Also, make sure that the `stock_prices` series is already loaded and available in the system. If not, you'll need to load it before calling the `forecast_values` function.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the ARIMA model parameters:

* `p`: The number of autoregressive terms. In this case, `p=1`.
* `d`: The number of differencing terms. In this case, `d=1`.
* `q`: The number of moving average terms. In this case, `q=1`.

You can adjust these parameters to suit your specific needs. For example, if you want to use a more complex model, you could try:

```json
{
  "function": "forecast_values",
  "series": "stock_prices",
  "periods": 6,
  "model": "ARIMA(2,1,2)"
}
```

This model uses 2 autoregressive terms, 1 differencing term, and 2 moving average terms.
