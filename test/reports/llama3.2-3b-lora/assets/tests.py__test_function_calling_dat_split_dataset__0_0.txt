Here's how you can split the `customer_data` into 80% training and 20% testing using the `split_dataset` function:

```json
{
  "function": "split_dataset",
  "dataset": "customer_data",
  "train_ratio": 0.8,
  "test_ratio": 0.2
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to use (`split_dataset`), the dataset to split (`customer_data`), and the ratios for training and testing data (80% for training and 20% for testing).
