There are several possible explanations for this pattern:

1. **Peak morning hours**: The gym is likely busiest during the morning hours, around 6-8 AM, when people are commuting to work or school. This is a common time for people to exercise before their day begins.
2. **Lunchtime drop-off**: At noon, people may be dropping off their children at school or daycare, and then heading to the gym to exercise before their day begins. This can lead to a temporary decrease in parking lot usage.
3. **Afternoon slump**: Afternoon hours, around 2-4 PM, may see a decrease in gym usage as people take a break or attend to other activities. This can result in a half-empty parking lot.
4. **Weekday vs. weekend usage**: The gym may experience more usage on weekdays (Monday-Friday) compared to weekends (Saturday-Sunday). This is because people are more likely to exercise during their lunch break or after work on weekdays.
5. **Membership patterns**: The gym may have a membership structure that attracts more people during certain hours of the day. For example, some gyms may have a "peak hour" membership plan that offers discounts for members who work during the morning hours.
6. **Local business and work patterns**: The gym may be located near a local business or office, and people may be using the gym as a way to take a break or exercise during their lunch hour. This can lead to a temporary increase in parking lot usage during the morning hours.

These are just a few possible explanations for the pattern you observed. The actual reason may be a combination of these factors or something else entirely.
