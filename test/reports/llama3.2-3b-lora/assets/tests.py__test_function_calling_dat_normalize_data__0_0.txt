Here's an example of how you can normalize the salary and experience columns using the min-max method:

```json
{
  "function": "normalize_data",
  "columns": ["salary", "experience"],
  "method": "min-max"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to use, the columns to normalize, and the normalization method as min-max. The `min-max` method scales the values in the specified columns to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.

Here's a breakdown of the JSON object:

* `function`: The function to use for normalization. In this case, it's `normalize_data`.
* `columns`: A list of column names to normalize. In this case, it's `["salary", "experience"]`.
* `method`: The normalization method to use. In this case, it's `min-max`.

When you call this function, it will return a normalized dataset with the specified columns scaled to the min-max range.
