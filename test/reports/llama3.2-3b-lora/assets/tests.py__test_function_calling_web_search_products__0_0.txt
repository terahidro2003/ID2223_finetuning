Here's an example of how you can use the `search_products` function to search for laptops in the electronics category with a maximum price of 1500:

```json
{
  "function": "search_products",
  "query": "laptop",
  "category": "electronics",
  "max_price": 1500
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to call, the query to search for ("laptop"), the category to search in ("electronics"), and the maximum price to filter the results by (1500).
