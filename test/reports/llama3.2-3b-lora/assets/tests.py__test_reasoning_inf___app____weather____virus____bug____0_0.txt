There could be several reasons why your phone battery is draining faster than usual. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Software updates**: Although you mentioned you haven't changed any settings, it's possible that a recent software update may have caused the battery drain. Sometimes, updates can introduce new features or bug fixes that consume more power.

2. **Background apps**: Even if you haven't downloaded any new apps, there might be existing apps running in the background that are consuming more power than usual. This could be due to a bug or an issue with the app itself.

3. **Location services**: If you've enabled location services for any apps, it could be causing the battery drain. Location services can consume a significant amount of power, especially if you're using them frequently.

4. **Screen brightness**: If your screen brightness is set too high, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Check if your screen brightness is set to its maximum level.

5. **Network activity**: If you're using a cellular network or Wi-Fi, it could be causing the battery drain. Check your network settings to see if you're using a data-intensive connection.

6. **Battery health**: It's possible that your phone's battery health is deteriorating, causing it to drain faster. You can check your battery health in your phone's settings.

7. **Hardware issues**: In some cases, a hardware issue with your phone's battery or charging circuitry could be causing the battery drain.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

- Restart your phone to see if it makes a difference.
- Check your phone's settings to see if there are any unusual settings or features enabled.
- Close any unnecessary apps or background processes.
- Check your network settings to see if you're using a data-intensive connection.
- Try to reduce your screen brightness and turn off location services for any apps that don't need them.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be worth visiting a authorized service center or contacting the manufacturer for further assistance.

Final Answer: The issue could be due to a software update, background apps, location services, screen brightness, network activity, battery health, or hardware issues.
