To determine the likely cause of the yellow leaves, let's consider a few possible factors:

1. **Overwatering**: Although you mentioned regular watering, it's possible that the plant is receiving too much water, especially if the soil is waterlogged. Yellow leaves can be a sign of root rot, which occurs when the roots are damaged by excess moisture.

2. **Underwatering**: On the other hand, the plant might be underwatered, especially during hot or dry weather. Yellow leaves can also be a sign of stress caused by lack of water.

3. **Nutrient deficiency**: Yellow leaves can be a sign of a nutrient deficiency, such as a lack of nitrogen, iron, or magnesium. This can be caused by poor soil quality, inadequate fertilization, or a lack of essential nutrients.

4. **Light exposure**: Yellow leaves can also be a sign of too much light exposure. Some plants can't handle direct sunlight, especially if it's intense.

5. **Pests or diseases**: Pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites can cause yellow leaves by sucking the sap from the plant. Fungal diseases like leaf spot or powdery mildew can also cause yellow leaves.

6. **Temperature fluctuations**: Sudden changes in temperature can cause stress to the plant, leading to yellow leaves.

7. **Soil pH**: Yellow leaves can also be a sign of soil pH imbalance. If the soil pH is too high or too low, it can cause nutrient deficiencies.

To narrow down the possible causes, can you tell me more about the plant, such as its type, environment, and recent changes in care?
