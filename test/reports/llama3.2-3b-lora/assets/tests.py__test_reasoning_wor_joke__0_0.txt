To solve this riddle, let's analyze the given options: cracked, made, told, and played.

1. Cracked: This could refer to cracking a joke or a puzzle, but it's not a common verb for the other options.
2. Made: This is a possible answer, as something can be made of various materials, but it's not the only option.
3. Told: This is another possible answer, as a story can be told, but it's not the only option.
4. Played: This could refer to playing a game, but it's not the only option.

Considering the options, I'm going to take a step further. What if the answer is not a physical object or a verb, but rather a concept or a type of entertainment?

In that case, I'm going to take a guess that the answer is a "joke." A joke can be cracked (as in, a joke can be cracked up), made (as in, a joke can be made up), told (as in, a joke can be told), and played (as in, a joke can be played on someone).

Final Answer: A joke.
