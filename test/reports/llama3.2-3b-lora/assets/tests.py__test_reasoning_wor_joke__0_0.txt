That's a clever riddle. Based on the given options, I'd say you are a "joke." 

- You can be "cracked" (as in, a joke can be cracked or told).
- You can be "made" (as in, a joke can be made up).
- You can be "told" (as in, a joke can be told to someone).
- You can be "played" (as in, a joke can be played on someone).

Am I correct?
