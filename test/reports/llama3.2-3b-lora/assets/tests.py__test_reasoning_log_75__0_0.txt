To find the distance the bird flies, we need to calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet and then multiply that time by the bird's speed.

The trains are 100 miles apart and are heading towards each other at 50 mph each. So, their combined speed is 50 + 50 = 100 mph.

Since they are moving towards each other, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 100 miles / 100 mph
Time = 1 hour

Now, we know that the bird flies for 1 hour at 75 mph. To find the distance the bird flies, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 75 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 75 miles

So, the bird flies 75 miles.
