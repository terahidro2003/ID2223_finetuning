To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the two trains to meet. Since they are heading towards each other, we can add their speeds to find their relative speed.

Relative speed = 50 mph + 50 mph = 100 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 100 miles / 100 mph = 1 hour

Since the bird flies at 75 mph, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 75 mph * 1 hour = 75 miles

Final Answer: 75 miles
