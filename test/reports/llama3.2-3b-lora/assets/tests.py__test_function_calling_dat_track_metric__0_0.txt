Here's an example of how you can track the `conversion_rate` metric with the given value and timestamp using the `track_metric` function:

```json
{
  "function": "track_metric",
  "metric_name": "conversion_rate",
  "value": 3.5,
  "timestamp": "2024-11-30T10:00:00"
}
```

This JSON object represents the data to be tracked, with the `conversion_rate` metric having a value of 3.5 and a timestamp of November 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM.
