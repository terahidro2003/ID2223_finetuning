Here's an example of how you can optimize the transactions table using the vacuum operation:

```json
{
  "function": "optimize_table",
  "table": "transactions",
  "operation": "vacuum"
}
```

This JSON object specifies that the `optimize_table` function should be used to optimize the `transactions` table, and that the `vacuum` operation should be performed. The `vacuum` operation is used to remove dead tuples from the table, which can help to improve query performance.
