The child is likely missing the skill of phonological awareness, specifically the ability to recognize and identify individual letters. Phonological awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate the sounds in words, including individual letters and letter combinations.

In this case, the child knows the alphabet song, which implies they have some knowledge of the sequence of letters, but they are unable to identify individual letters. This suggests that they may need additional practice and instruction to develop their phonological awareness skills, particularly in recognizing and identifying letters.

Some strategies to help the child develop this skill include:

* Practicing letter recognition through flashcards, games, and activities
* Using letter-tracing worksheets to help the child develop fine motor skills and letter recognition
* Engaging in phonics-based activities, such as sounding out words and identifying letter combinations
* Playing letter-matching games and other interactive activities to make learning fun and engaging

By developing phonological awareness skills, the child will be better equipped to recognize and identify individual letters, and ultimately, to read and write with greater accuracy and confidence.
