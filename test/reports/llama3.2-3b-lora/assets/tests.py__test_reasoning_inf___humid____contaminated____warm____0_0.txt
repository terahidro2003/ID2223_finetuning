To determine the likely cause of the moldy bread, let's consider the factors that could contribute to mold growth on bread.

1. Temperature: Mold thrives in warm temperatures. If the room temperature was higher than the recommended storage temperature for bread (usually around 68°F to 72°F or 20°C to 22°C), it could have accelerated the growth of mold.
2. Humidity: High humidity can also contribute to mold growth. If the environment was more humid than usual, it could have created an ideal environment for mold to develop.
3. Contamination: Although the bread was bought only 2 days ago, it's possible that the mold was introduced during handling or storage. This could have occurred if the bread was not stored properly or if the packaging was compromised.
4. Storage conditions: If the bread was stored in a warm, damp, or poorly ventilated area, it could have created an environment conducive to mold growth.

Considering these factors, a likely cause of the moldy bread is an environment with high temperature and humidity, or poor storage conditions.

Final Answer: Poor storage conditions or high temperature and humidity.
