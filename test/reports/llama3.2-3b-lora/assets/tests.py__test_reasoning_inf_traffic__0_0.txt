There could be several bottlenecks causing the website to load slowly only during business hours. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Network congestion**: During business hours, more users are accessing the website, which can lead to increased network congestion. This can be caused by a large number of concurrent connections, high traffic, or a lack of bandwidth.
2. **Server overload**: The server hosting the website might be experiencing an overload of requests during business hours, causing it to slow down or become unresponsive.
3. **Database queries**: If the website relies on a database to store and retrieve data, the database queries might be slowing down the website during business hours. This could be due to a large number of concurrent requests or a lack of indexing.
4. **Content delivery network (CDN) issues**: If the website uses a CDN to distribute content, issues with the CDN might be causing the website to load slowly during business hours.
5. **Bandwidth limitations**: The website's bandwidth might be limited during business hours, causing the website to slow down or become unresponsive.
6. **High traffic from a single source**: If a single source, such as a large company or organization, is accessing the website during business hours, it could be causing the bottleneck.
7. **Server-side scripting**: If the website relies on server-side scripting, such as PHP or Ruby, it might be slowing down the website during business hours due to the increased load.
8. **Database indexing**: If the database indexing is not optimized, it might be slowing down the website during business hours.
9. **Caching issues**: If the website's caching mechanism is not working correctly, it might be causing the website to load slowly during business hours.
10. **Network latency**: High network latency between the website's server and the users' devices could be causing the website to load slowly during business hours.

To identify the bottleneck, you can try the following:

* Monitor the website's performance using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Google Analytics.
* Analyze the website's server logs to identify any errors or issues.
* Use tools like Apache Bench or JMeter to simulate a large number of concurrent requests.
* Check the website's database queries and indexing to ensure they are optimized.
* Monitor the website's bandwidth usage to ensure it is not exceeding the limits.
* Test the website's performance during off-peak hours to see if the bottleneck is consistent.
