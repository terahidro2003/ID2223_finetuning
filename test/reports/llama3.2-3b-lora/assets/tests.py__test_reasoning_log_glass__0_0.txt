To answer this question, we need to think about the characteristics of a greenhouse. A greenhouse is typically made of transparent or translucent materials that allow sunlight to enter and warm the interior. 

Considering the given information about houses being made of colored bricks, it's likely that a greenhouse would be made of materials that are transparent or translucent, rather than colored bricks. 

Some common materials used to make greenhouses include glass, polycarbonate, or acrylic panels. These materials allow sunlight to enter and warm the interior, while also providing protection from the elements.

Final Answer: Glass, polycarbonate, or acrylic panels.
