Based on the child's behavior, it appears that they are likely in the "Evaluative" stage of cognitive development, which typically occurs between the ages of 2 and 4 years old.

During this stage, children are beginning to question and evaluate the information they receive, often asking "why" to clarify or understand the context. They are also starting to develop their critical thinking skills and are more likely to challenge or dispute information that doesn't make sense to them.

Some other characteristics of children in this stage include:

* Asking "why" frequently, often in response to a statement
* Demonstrating curiosity and a desire to learn more
* Showing an interest in understanding the underlying logic or reasoning behind a statement
* Beginning to develop their problem-solving skills and think more logically

Keep in mind that every child develops at their own pace, and some may exhibit these characteristics earlier or later than others. However, the "Evaluative" stage is a common stage of cognitive development that is characterized by this type of questioning and critical thinking.
