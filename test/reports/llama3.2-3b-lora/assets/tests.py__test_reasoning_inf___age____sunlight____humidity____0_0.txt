To determine the cause of the book's yellowing and brittleness, let's consider the factors that can contribute to these changes.

1. **Light exposure**: Direct sunlight or UV rays can cause the paper to degrade, leading to yellowing and brittleness. This is because UV radiation breaks down the cellulose fibers in the paper, causing it to weaken and become brittle.

2. **Moisture**: High humidity or exposure to water can also cause paper to yellow and become brittle. When paper absorbs moisture, the cellulose fibers can swell, leading to a breakdown in the paper's structure.

3. **Aging**: As paper ages, it naturally undergoes a process called "gelatinization," where the cellulose fibers break down and become more brittle. This process is accelerated by factors like light, moisture, and temperature fluctuations.

Considering the book was kept indoors, it's likely that the yellowing and brittleness are due to one or more of these factors. However, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

If the book was exposed to direct sunlight or had high humidity levels, that could be a contributing factor. Alternatively, if the book was stored in a damp or humid environment, that could also be the cause.

Final Answer: The yellowing and brittleness of the book are likely due to exposure to light, moisture, or a combination of both.
