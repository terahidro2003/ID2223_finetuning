There are several factors that could contribute to a book's pages becoming yellowed and brittle, even if it's been kept indoors. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Age**: As books get older, the paper they're printed on can break down over time, causing the pages to yellow and become brittle. This is a natural process, but it can be accelerated by exposure to light, moisture, and other environmental factors.
2. **Light exposure**: Ultraviolet (UV) light from sunlight or artificial sources can cause the paper to degrade, leading to yellowing and brittleness. This is especially true for books that are exposed to direct sunlight or have been stored near windows.
3. **Moisture**: High humidity or water damage can cause the paper to become soggy and brittle. This can happen if the book has been exposed to flooding, dampness, or high humidity in its storage environment.
4. **Handling and wear**: Physical handling of the book, such as turning pages or storing it in a tight space, can cause wear and tear on the paper. This can lead to yellowing and brittleness over time.
5. **Ink and pigment degradation**: The ink and pigments used in printing can break down over time, causing the text and images to fade or become discolored. This can lead to yellowing and brittleness of the pages.
6. **Acidic or alkaline environments**: The pH level of the environment can affect the paper's stability. If the book is stored in an acidic or alkaline environment, it can cause the paper to degrade and become brittle.
7. **Insect damage**: Insects like book lice, silverfish, or carpet beetles can feed on the paper, causing damage and discoloration.
8. **Storage conditions**: Poor storage conditions, such as storing books in a damp or humid environment, can contribute to yellowing and brittleness.

To slow down the degradation process, it's essential to store books in a cool, dry, and dark environment, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Regularly inspecting and conserving books can also help preserve their condition.
