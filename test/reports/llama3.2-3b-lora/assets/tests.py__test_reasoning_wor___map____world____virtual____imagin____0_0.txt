This is a classic riddle. Let's break it down step by step.

The riddle states that you have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, and water but no fish. This suggests that the answer is not a physical location or a living thing, but rather a concept or an abstraction.

Cities, forests, and water are all physical entities that can be found in the world. However, the absence of houses, trees, and fish in these entities suggests that the answer is something that represents or is related to these entities, but is not the entities themselves.

One possible interpretation is that the answer is a map. A map typically represents cities, forests, and water, but it does not contain houses, trees, or fish. This fits the description in the riddle.

Another possible interpretation is that the answer is a diagram or a representation of these entities. However, the phrase "I have cities but no houses" suggests a more concrete representation, which is why the map interpretation seems more likely.

Final Answer: A map.
