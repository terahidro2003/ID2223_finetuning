To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the major events and milestones of World War II. 

World War II officially began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. However, the war in Europe ended with the defeat of Germany in 1945. 

The war in the Pacific, however, continued until the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945. 

Considering both European and Pacific theaters, the correct answer is C) 1945.
