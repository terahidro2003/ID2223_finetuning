Here's an example of how you can provision a t3.large VM in us-west-2 with Ubuntu using the cloud resource manager:

```json
{
  "function": "provision_vm",
  "instance_type": "t3.large",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "os": "ubuntu"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to call, which is `provision_vm`.
- `instance_type`: The type of instance to provision, which is `t3.large`.
- `region`: The region where the instance will be created, which is `us-west-2`.
- `os`: The operating system to use, which is `ubuntu`.

When you call this function, it will create a new instance of the specified type and operating system in the specified region.
