To solve this problem, we can use a process of elimination. Here's one possible approach:

1. Start by flipping switch 1 to the "on" position for 5 minutes.
2. Then, flip switch 1 to the "off" position and flip switch 2 to the "on" position.
3. Immediately go into the room and observe the bulbs.

Now, let's analyze the possible outcomes:

- If a bulb is on, it must be controlled by switch 2.
- If a bulb is off but warm, it must be controlled by switch 1.
- If a bulb is off and cold, it must be controlled by switch 3.

By doing this, you can determine which switch controls which bulb in just one visit to the room.

Final Answer: Yes
