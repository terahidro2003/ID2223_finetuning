To determine why the coffee shop is nearly empty at 2 PM, let's consider the typical daily routine of its customers.

1. Monday is a workday, and many people start their day with a cup of coffee from the coffee shop.
2. The line at 8 AM suggests that many customers are arriving at the shop to start their day with coffee.
3. However, as the day progresses, many of these customers will likely be at work, attending classes, or engaged in other activities that don't involve visiting the coffee shop.
4. Additionally, some customers may have already had their morning coffee and are no longer in need of a mid-day coffee break.
5. The shop may also be closed or have limited hours during the afternoon, which could further contribute to the emptiness.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the coffee shop is nearly empty at 2 PM because many of its customers are no longer in need of coffee due to their daily activities, and the shop may have limited hours or be closed during the afternoon.

Final Answer: Many customers are no longer in need of coffee due to their daily activities, and the shop may have limited hours or be closed during the afternoon.
