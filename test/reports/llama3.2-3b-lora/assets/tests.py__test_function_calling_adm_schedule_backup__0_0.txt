Here's an example of how you can schedule daily backups for customer-data with 30 day retention using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "schedule_backup",
  "resource": "customer-data",
  "frequency": "daily",
  "retention": 30
}
```

This JSON object specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to use for scheduling the backup, which is `schedule_backup`.
- `resource`: The resource to be backed up, which is `customer-data`.
- `frequency`: The frequency at which the backup should be performed, which is `daily`.
- `retention`: The number of days to retain the backup, which is 30.

This will schedule daily backups for the customer-data with a 30 day retention period.
