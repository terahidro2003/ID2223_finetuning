To solve this problem, we need to figure out which guard is the truth-teller and which one is the liar. 

We can ask one of the guards, "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?" 

If the guard we ask is the truth-teller, they will tell us what the liar would say, which would be the door that leads to death. 

If the guard we ask is the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also be the door that leads to death.

In either case, the guard we ask will tell us that the other guard would point to the door that leads to death. 

So, we can safely assume that the guard we asked is the truth-teller, and we can ask the other guard which door leads to freedom.

Final Answer: Ask the other guard which door leads to freedom.
