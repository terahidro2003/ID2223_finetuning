This is a classic puzzle. To solve it, you need to ask a question that will give you the same answer from both guards, regardless of their nature.

You should ask: "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?"

Think about it: 

- If you ask the truth-teller, they will tell you what the liar would say, which is the door that leads to death.
- If you ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which is also the door that leads to death.

In both cases, the answer will be the same: the door that leads to death. So, you can safely choose the other door.
