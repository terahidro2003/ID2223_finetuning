Here's an example of how you can detect seasonality in the `revenue_data` series with a 12-month period using the `detect_seasonality` function:

```json
{
  "function": "detect_seasonality",
  "data": "revenue_data",
  "period": 12
}
```

This will return a dictionary with the following keys:

- `seasonality`: A dictionary containing the seasonality pattern and its corresponding period.
- `trend`: A dictionary containing the trend of the seasonality pattern.
- `residuals`: A dictionary containing the residuals of the seasonality pattern.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```json
{
  "seasonality": {
    "pattern": "sin",
    "period": 12
  },
  "trend": {
    "slope": 0.05,
    "intercept": 1000
  },
  "residuals": {
    "mean": 0,
    "std": 100
  }
}
```

This indicates that the revenue data has a seasonal pattern with a period of 12 months, a trend of a 5% increase per month, and residuals with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 100.
