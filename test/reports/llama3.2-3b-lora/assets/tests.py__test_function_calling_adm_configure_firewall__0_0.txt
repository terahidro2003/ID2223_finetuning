Here's an example of how you can configure the firewall to block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 with a priority of 10:

```json
{
  "function": "configure_firewall",
  "rule": "block_traffic_from_1921681",
  "action": "deny",
  "priority": 10
}
```

In this example, the `rule` is set to `block_traffic_from_1921681`, which can be used to identify the specific traffic rule. The `action` is set to `deny`, which means that traffic from the specified IP range will be blocked. The `priority` is set to 10, which means that this rule will be evaluated before other rules with lower priorities.

You can also include additional information in the rule, such as the IP range to block, like this:

```json
{
  "function": "configure_firewall",
  "rule": "block_traffic_from_1921681",
  "action": "deny",
  "priority": 10,
  "source_ip_range": "192.168.1.0/24"
}
```

This way, you can specify the exact IP range to block, making the rule more specific and effective.
