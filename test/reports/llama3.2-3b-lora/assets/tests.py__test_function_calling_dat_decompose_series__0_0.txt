Here's an example of how you can decompose the `monthly_sales` series using an additive model:

```json
{
  "function": "decompose_series",
  "series": "monthly_sales",
  "model": "additive"
}
```

This will decompose the `monthly_sales` series into three components:

- Trend (long-term changes in the series)
- Seasonal (recurring patterns, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Residual (short-term random fluctuations)

The `additive` model assumes that the series can be decomposed into the sum of three components, each of which is a function of time. The decomposition is typically represented as:

`Series = Trend + Seasonal + Residual`

Note that the `additive` model is a common choice for time series decomposition, but other models like `multiplicative` or `holt-winters` may also be used depending on the characteristics of the series.
