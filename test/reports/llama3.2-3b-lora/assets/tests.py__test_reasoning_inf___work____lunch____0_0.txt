To explain this pattern, let's break it down step by step.

1. The gym parking lot is full at 6 AM, which means that all available parking spaces are occupied by 6 AM.
2. At 6 AM, the gym is likely to be closed, as it's early morning and people are not yet arriving for their workouts.
3. As the day progresses, more people arrive at the gym, and the parking lot becomes increasingly full.
4. By noon, the gym is likely to be in full operation, with people arriving for their workouts and using the parking lot.
5. However, the parking lot is half-empty at noon, which suggests that some people are choosing not to park in the gym's parking lot.

There are several possible explanations for this pattern:

* Some people may be using alternative parking options, such as street parking or parking at nearby lots.
* Some people may be carpooling or using public transportation to get to the gym.
* The gym may have implemented a parking policy that discourages or limits parking, such as a limited number of free parking spots or a fee for parking.
* The gym may be located in an area with limited parking options, making it difficult for people to find parking.

These are just a few possible explanations for the pattern of a full parking lot at 6 AM and a half-empty parking lot at noon.

Final Answer: The pattern can be explained by various factors such as alternative parking options, carpooling, public transportation, or limited parking options.
