There are several likely causes for a faster-draining phone battery than usual, even if you haven't changed any settings. Here are some possibilities:

1. **Software updates**: New software updates can sometimes cause battery drain issues. Check for any recent updates and see if installing them resolves the issue.
2. **Resource-intensive apps**: Certain apps, such as games, video editors, or social media apps, can consume more power than usual. Try closing or limiting the use of these apps to see if it improves battery life.
3. **Location services and GPS**: If your phone is using location services or GPS more frequently than usual, it can drain the battery faster. Try disabling location services or reducing the frequency of GPS usage.
4. **Background apps**: Some apps may be running in the background and consuming power even when you're not actively using them. Check your phone's battery usage to identify any suspicious apps.
5. **Screen brightness and auto-brightness**: If your screen brightness is set too high or if the auto-brightness feature is enabled, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Try adjusting the screen brightness or disabling auto-brightness.
6. **Network activity**: If you're using a cellular network or Wi-Fi extensively, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Try reducing your network activity or switching to a different network.
7. **Battery health**: Over time, your phone's battery can degrade, causing it to drain faster. Check your phone's battery health to see if it's within the manufacturer's recommended range.
8. **Hardware issues**: In some cases, a faster-draining battery can be caused by a hardware issue, such as a faulty battery or a malfunctioning charging port. If you've tried the above steps and the issue persists, it may be worth contacting the manufacturer or a repair service.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

* Check your phone's battery usage to identify any suspicious apps or activities.
* Disable any location services or GPS usage that you're not actively using.
* Adjust your screen brightness and auto-brightness settings.
* Limit your network activity or switch to a different network.
* Check your phone's battery health to see if it's within the manufacturer's recommended range.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be worth contacting the manufacturer or a repair service for further assistance.
