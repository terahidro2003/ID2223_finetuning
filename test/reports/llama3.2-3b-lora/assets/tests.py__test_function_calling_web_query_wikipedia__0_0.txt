I can simulate the Wikipedia query function for you. Here's the result:

{
  "title": "Quantum Computing",
  "content": "Quantum computing is a field of computer science that uses quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. It is a rapidly growing field, with significant potential to revolutionize many areas of science and technology.",
  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"
}

Note that the actual Wikipedia content may vary depending on the current state of the article. This is just a simulated result.
