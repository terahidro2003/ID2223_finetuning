To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

The snail climbs 3 feet up and slides back 2 feet at night, so it effectively moves 1 foot up each day.

Since the well is 30 feet deep, the snail needs to move 30 feet up to reach the top.

To find out how many days it takes for the snail to reach the top, we can divide the total distance (30 feet) by the daily progress (1 foot):

30 feet / 1 foot/day = 30 days

However, this calculation assumes that the snail will climb 3 feet on the final day and reach the top without sliding back. Since the snail can't climb more than 3 feet on the final day, we need to subtract 1 foot from the total distance to account for the snail's final climb:

30 feet - 3 feet = 27 feet

Now, we can divide the adjusted distance by the daily progress:

27 feet / 1 foot/day = 27 days

So, it will take the snail 27 days to reach the top of the 30-foot well.
