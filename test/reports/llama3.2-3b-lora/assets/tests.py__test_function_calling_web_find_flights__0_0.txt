Here's the JSON request to find flights from Stockholm to Paris on 2024-12-15 for 2 passengers:

```json
{
  "function": "find_flights",
  "origin": "Stockholm",
  "destination": "Paris",
  "date": "2024-12-15",
  "passengers": 2
}
```

I'll now simulate the response from the travel information agent:

```json
{
  "flights": [
    {
      "flight_number": "SA1234",
      "airline": "SAS",
      "departure_time": "08:00",
      "arrival_time": "10:30",
      "price": 500
    },
    {
      "flight_number": "AF5678",
      "airline": "Air France",
      "departure_time": "09:00",
      "arrival_time": "11:00",
      "price": 600
    },
    {
      "flight_number": "Lufthansa 9012",
      "airline": "Lufthansa",
      "departure_time": "10:00",
      "arrival_time": "12:00",
      "price": 700
    }
  ]
}
```
