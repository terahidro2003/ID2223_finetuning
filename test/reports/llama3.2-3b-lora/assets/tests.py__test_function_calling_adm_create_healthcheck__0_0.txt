Here's an example of how you can create a healthcheck for `https://api.example.com/health` every 60 seconds with a 5-second timeout using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "create_healthcheck",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "interval_seconds": 60,
  "timeout": 5
}
```

This JSON object defines a healthcheck that:

- Uses the `create_healthcheck` function
- Points to the `https://api.example.com/health` endpoint
- Checks the health every 60 seconds
- Waits for a maximum of 5 seconds for the endpoint to respond
