To deduce the person's likely profession or hobby, let's analyze the given clues:

1. Paint under their fingernails: This suggests that the person has been handling paint, possibly for an extended period. This could be related to a profession or hobby that involves working with paint.

2. Smells like turpentine: Turpentine is a solvent commonly used in the art world, particularly in oil painting. It's often used to thin oil paints and clean brushes. The strong, pungent smell of turpentine is a distinctive characteristic that can be associated with artists or art-related activities.

Considering these clues, it's likely that the person is an artist, specifically an oil painter. The paint under their fingernails and the turpentine smell are both consistent with the demands of oil painting.

However, it's also possible that the person is a hobbyist or enthusiast who enjoys oil painting, but is not a professional artist. In this case, the person might be a part-time painter or someone who enjoys the hobby in their free time.

Final Answer: An oil painter or an artist.
