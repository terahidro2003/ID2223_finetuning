The correct answer is B) Stack.

A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This is in contrast to a queue, which follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

- A) Queue: A queue follows the FIFO principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
- C) Array: An array does not follow a specific principle, as it is a collection of elements that can be accessed in any order.
- D) Tree: A tree is a data structure that does not follow a specific principle, as it is a collection of nodes that can be accessed in any order.

So, the stack is the only data structure among the options that uses the LIFO principle.
