There could be several reasons why a movie theater is packed on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Escape from the rain**: People might be seeking a dry and comfortable place to escape the rain and spend their Saturday afternoon indoors.
2. **Movie marathon or event**: The theater might be hosting a movie marathon or a special event, such as a premiere or a themed screening, which could attract a large crowd.
3. **School or work group outing**: It's possible that a group of students or employees from a nearby school or office might be taking a break or going on a field trip to the movie theater.
4. **Family outing**: A rainy Saturday afternoon is a great excuse for families to spend quality time together, and the movie theater might be a popular destination for family outings.
5. **New release or popular movie**: The theater might be showing a highly anticipated new release or a popular movie that people want to see.

To narrow down the possibilities, we would need more information about the specific movie theater and the context of the situation.

Final Answer: It could be a combination of these factors or something else entirely.
