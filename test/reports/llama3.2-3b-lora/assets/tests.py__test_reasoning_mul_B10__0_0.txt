To find the binary representation of decimal 10, we need to divide 10 by 2 and keep track of the remainders.

10 / 2 = 5 remainder 0
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 / 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1

Now, let's read the remainders from bottom to top: 1010.

So, the binary representation of decimal 10 is 1010.
