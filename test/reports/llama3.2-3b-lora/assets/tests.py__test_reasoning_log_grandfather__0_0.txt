To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are two fathers and two sons, and they each catch one fish. The total number of fish caught is 3.

One possible explanation is that the two fathers are also the two sons' fathers. In other words, the two fathers are the grandfather and the father of the two sons.

For example, if the grandfather and the father are the two fathers, and the grandfather catches a fish, the father catches a fish, and the two sons catch the remaining fish.

This explanation satisfies the condition that only 3 fish are caught total, as the grandfather, the father, and the two sons are all related to each other.

Final Answer: The two fathers are the grandfather and the father of the two sons.
