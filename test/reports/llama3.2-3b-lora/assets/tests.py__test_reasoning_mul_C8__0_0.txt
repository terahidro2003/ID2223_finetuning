The correct answer is C) 404.

The HTTP status code 404 indicates that the requested resource was not found. It is often referred to as the "Not Found" status code.

Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

* 200: OK - indicates that the request was successful and the requested resource was found.
* 301: Moved Permanently - indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
* 500: Internal Server Error - indicates that the server encountered an error while processing the request, but the resource was not necessarily not found.
