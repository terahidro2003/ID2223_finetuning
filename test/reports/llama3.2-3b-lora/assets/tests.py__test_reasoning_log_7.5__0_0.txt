To find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to calculate the positions of both hands.

The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour. Since it's 3:15, the hour hand has moved 3 hours and 15 minutes from the 12 o'clock position. 

15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So, the hour hand has moved 0.25 * 30 = 7.5 degrees.

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. At 15 minutes, the minute hand has moved 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.

Now, we need to find the angle between the two hands. Since the hour hand is at 7.5 degrees and the minute hand is at 90 degrees, we can subtract the hour hand position from the minute hand position to get the angle between them.

Angle = 90 - 7.5 = 82.5 degrees.

So, the angle between the hour and minute hands is 82.5 degrees.
