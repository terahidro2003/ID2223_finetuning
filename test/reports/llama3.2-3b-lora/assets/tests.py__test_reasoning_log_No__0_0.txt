To answer this question, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.

Statement 1: All roses are flowers.
Statement 2: Some flowers fade quickly.

From Statement 1, we know that roses are a subset of flowers. From Statement 2, we know that some flowers (in general) fade quickly.

However, we cannot conclude that all roses fade quickly. The statement "some flowers fade quickly" does not imply that all flowers fade quickly. It only implies that at least some flowers do.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that all roses fade quickly.

Final Answer: No
