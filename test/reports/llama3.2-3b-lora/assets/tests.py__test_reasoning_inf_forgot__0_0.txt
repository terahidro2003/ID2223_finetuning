There are several possible reasons why the office lights are on but nobody is there at 10 PM on a Sunday. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Maintenance or cleaning**: The office might be undergoing maintenance or cleaning, and the lights are left on to illuminate the space.
2. **Security**: The office might be equipped with security cameras or motion-sensitive lights that are triggered by movement, even if there's no one there.
3. **Utility or electrical issue**: There might be a utility or electrical issue that's causing the lights to stay on, such as a faulty circuit breaker or a malfunctioning thermostat.
4. **Preparation for the next day**: The office might be preparing for the next day, such as setting up equipment or preparing for a meeting, and the lights are left on to create a welcoming atmosphere.
5. **Power outage**: Although it's 10 PM on a Sunday, there might be a power outage in the area, and the office is still lit up.
6. **Security personnel**: The office might have security personnel on duty, even on weekends, to ensure the building is secure.
7. **Emergency lighting**: The office might have emergency lighting installed, which is designed to stay on in case of a power outage or other emergency.

These are just a few possibilities, and there might be other reasons why the office lights are on but nobody is there.
