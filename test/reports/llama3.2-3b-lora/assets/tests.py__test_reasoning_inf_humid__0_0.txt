There are several conditions that could have caused the mold to grow on the bread in just 2 days. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **High humidity**: If the environment is too humid, it can create an ideal breeding ground for mold. This could be due to a leaky roof, poor ventilation, or a humid climate.
2. **Temperature fluctuations**: If the temperature is consistently above 70°F (21°C) or below 50°F (10°C), it can create an environment conducive to mold growth.
3. **Poor storage conditions**: If the bread was stored in a warm, damp, or poorly ventilated area, it can create an ideal environment for mold to grow.
4. **Cross-contamination**: If the bread was stored near other moldy or contaminated items, it can transfer spores and cause mold to grow.
5. **Contaminated packaging**: If the bread was packaged in a container that was not properly cleaned or sanitized, it can introduce mold spores into the bread.
6. **Inadequate packaging**: If the bread was not properly sealed or wrapped, it can allow moisture and air to enter, creating an environment for mold to grow.
7. **Contaminated air**: If the air is contaminated with mold spores, it can settle on the bread and cause mold to grow.

It's worth noting that mold can grow on bread in as little as 24-48 hours, especially if it's exposed to high humidity, temperature fluctuations, or poor storage conditions.
