Here's an example of how you can join the customers and orders tables using the `join_tables` function:

```json
{
  "function": "join_tables",
  "left_table": "customers",
  "right_table": "orders",
  "join_key": "customer_id"
}
```

This will join the customers and orders tables on the `customer_id` column, creating a new table that combines data from both tables. The resulting table will have columns from both tables, with the `customer_id` column serving as the common key.

For example, if the customers table has columns `id`, `name`, and `email`, and the orders table has columns `id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `total`, the resulting table might look like this:

| id | name | email | id | customer_id | order_date | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | John | john@example.com | 101 | 1 | 2022-01-01 | 100.00 |
| 2  | Jane | jane@example.com | 102 | 1 | 2022-01-15 | 200.00 |
| 3  | Bob  | bob@example.com | 103 | 2 | 2022-02-01 | 50.00  |

Note that the actual resulting table will depend on the specific columns and data in your customers and orders tables.
