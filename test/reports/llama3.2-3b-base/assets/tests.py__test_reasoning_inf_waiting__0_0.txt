To determine what the person is likely doing, let's consider the context and possible reasons for checking their watch repeatedly.

1. Time: The person is in a cafe, which is a public place, and they are checking their watch. This suggests that they are waiting for someone or something, and the time is likely a factor.

2. Social interaction: Cafes are often used for socializing, and the person might be waiting for a friend, family member, or someone they are meeting.

3. Appointments: The person might be waiting for an appointment, such as a meeting or a scheduled event.

Considering these possibilities, the person is likely waiting for someone or something, and the repeated checks of their watch suggest that they are anxious or impatient about the timing.

Final Answer: Waiting for someone or something.
