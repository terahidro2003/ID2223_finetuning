Here's an example of how you can set the threshold for the `cpu_usage` metric greater than 80 using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "set_metric_threshold",
  "metric": "cpu_usage",
  "operator": "gt",
  "value": 80
}
```

In this example, the `set_metric_threshold` function is used to set the threshold for the `cpu_usage` metric. The `operator` is set to "gt" (greater than), and the `value` is set to 80. This means that if the `cpu_usage` metric exceeds 80, the system will trigger an alert.
