Here's an example of how you can use the `forecast_values` function to forecast the next 6 periods for the `stock_prices` series using an ARIMA model:

```json
{
  "function": "forecast_values",
  "series": "stock_prices",
  "periods": 6,
  "model": "ARIMA(1,1,1)"
}
```

In this example, we're using an ARIMA model with 1 autoregressive term, 1 differencing term, and 1 moving average term. The `(1,1,1)` part of the string specifies these parameters.

Please note that the `forecast_values` function requires a valid series and a valid model. The model string should be in the format `ARIMA(p,d,q)`, where `p` is the number of autoregressive terms, `d` is the number of differencing terms, and `q` is the number of moving average terms.

Also, make sure that the `stock_prices` series is a valid time series and that the model is correctly specified. If the model is not correctly specified, the forecast may not be accurate.
