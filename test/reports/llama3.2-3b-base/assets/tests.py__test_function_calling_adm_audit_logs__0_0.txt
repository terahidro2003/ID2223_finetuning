Here's an example of how you can use the `audit_logs` function to review logs for the auth-service in the last 24 hours, filtering for failed logins:

```json
{
  "function": "audit_logs",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "time_range": "24h",
  "filter": "failed_logins"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to call, which is `audit_logs`.
- `service`: The service to review logs for, which is `auth-service`.
- `time_range`: The time range to review logs for, which is the last 24 hours (`24h`).
- `filter`: The filter to apply to the logs, which is `failed_logins`.

When you call this function, it will return a list of logs for the auth-service in the last 24 hours that match the filter for failed logins.
