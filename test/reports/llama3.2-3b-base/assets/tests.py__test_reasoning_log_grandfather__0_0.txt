To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step.

We know that there are two fathers and two sons, and they each catch one fish. The total number of fish caught is 3.

One possible explanation is that the two fathers are also the two sons' fathers. In other words, the two fathers are the grandfather and the father of the two sons.

Since the two fathers are the same two people, they can't both catch a fish. However, the two sons can catch two fish between them.

So, the two fathers (grandfather and father) catch one fish together, and the two sons catch the other two fish.

Final Answer: A grandfather and his son (the father) go fishing.
