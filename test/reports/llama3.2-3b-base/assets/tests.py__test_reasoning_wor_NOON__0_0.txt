To solve this, let's consider the properties of the word you're looking for. It needs to be a 4-letter word that can be read the same when written forward, backward, and upside down.

One possible solution is the word "SWIMS". When written forward, it's "SWIMS". When written backward, it's still "SWIMS". However, when written upside down, it's not the same.

Another possible solution is the word "NOON". When written forward, it's "NOON". When written backward, it's still "NOON". And when written upside down, it's still "NOON".

Considering these properties, a more suitable solution is the word "NOON".
