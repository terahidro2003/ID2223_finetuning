To identify the bottleneck, let's analyze the situation:

1. The website loads slowly only during business hours, which suggests that the issue is related to the time of day or the volume of traffic.
2. Business hours typically coincide with peak usage times, such as lunch breaks or afternoon rushes.
3. The website's slow loading times may be caused by various factors, including:
	* High traffic volume
	* Insufficient server resources (e.g., CPU, memory, or bandwidth)
	* Network congestion
	* Database queries or other backend operations
	* Poorly optimized website code or inefficient caching mechanisms
4. To further investigate, consider the following questions:
	* Are the slow loading times consistent across all users, or is it only affecting specific users or groups?
	* Are there any other issues with the website, such as errors or broken functionality?
	* Have there been any recent changes to the website's infrastructure, code, or configuration?
5. Based on these factors, some potential bottlenecks could be:
	* High traffic volume during business hours, which may be overwhelming the server's resources.
	* Insufficient server resources, such as CPU or memory, which may be limiting the website's performance.
	* Network congestion, which could be caused by a high volume of traffic or other network issues.
	* Poorly optimized website code or inefficient caching mechanisms, which may be contributing to slow loading times.

Final Answer: The bottleneck could be high traffic volume during business hours, which may be overwhelming the server's resources.
