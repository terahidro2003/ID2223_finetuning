To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the major events and milestones of World War II. 

World War II officially began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. However, the war in Europe ended with the defeat of Germany in 1945. 

The war in the Pacific, however, continued until the end of World War II. The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. 

Japan formally surrendered to the Allied Powers on September 2, 1945, marking the official end of World War II.

Final Answer: 1945
