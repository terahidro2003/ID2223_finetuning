The correct answer is B) Singleton.

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used when a class needs to maintain a state that needs to be shared across an application, or when a class needs to be instantiated only once.

Here's a simple example of the Singleton pattern in Python:

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

This design pattern is useful when you need to ensure that a class is instantiated only once, and you want to provide a global point of access to that instance.
