Here's an example of how you can create a full backup of the `database-prod` database to an S3 bucket using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "create_backup",
  "source": "database-prod",
  "destination": "s3://backups/",
  "type": "full"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the `create_backup` function, which will create a full backup of the `database-prod` database and store it in the `s3://backups/` bucket.
