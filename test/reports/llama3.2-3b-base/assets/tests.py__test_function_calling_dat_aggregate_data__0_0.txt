Here's an example of how you can use the `aggregate_data` function to aggregate sales by region using the sum operation:

```json
{
  "function": "aggregate_data",
  "table": "sales",
  "group_by": "region",
  "operation": "sum"
}
```

In this example, the `aggregate_data` function is used to aggregate the data in the `sales` table by the `region` column, and the `sum` operation is used to calculate the total sales for each region.

Here's a breakdown of the parameters:

* `table`: The name of the table to aggregate.
* `group_by`: The column to group the data by.
* `operation`: The operation to perform on the grouped data. In this case, it's `sum`, which means the total sales for each region will be calculated.

Note that the `aggregate_data` function will return a JSON object with the aggregated data, where each key is a unique value in the `region` column, and the value is the total sales for that region.

For example, if the `sales` table contains the following data:

| region | sales |
| --- | --- |
| North | 100 |
| South | 200 |
| East | 300 |
| West | 400 |

The `aggregate_data` function will return the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "North": 100,
  "South": 200,
  "East": 300,
  "West": 400
}
```

This shows that the total sales for the North region is 100, the South region is 200, the East region is 300, and the West region is 400.
