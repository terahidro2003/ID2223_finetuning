Here's an example of how you can use the `lookup_company` function to retrieve Tesla's company info for revenue and employees fields:

```json
{
  "function": "lookup_company",
  "company_name": "Tesla, Inc.",
  "fields": ["revenue", "employees"]
}
```

This JSON object specifies the `lookup_company` function and passes in the company name "Tesla, Inc." along with the fields `revenue` and `employees` that you want to retrieve.
