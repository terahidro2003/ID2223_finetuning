The correct answer is C) Mitochondria.

The mitochondria is often referred to as the "powerhouse" of the cell because it generates most of the cell's energy through a process called cellular respiration. It converts the energy from the food we eat into a form that the cell can use, called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This energy is then used to power the cell's various functions, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulses, and biosynthesis.

The other options are not correct because:

* The nucleus (A) is the control center of the cell, containing the genetic material and regulating cell growth and division.
* The ribosome (B) is responsible for protein synthesis, translating messenger RNA into proteins.
* The chloroplast (D) is found in plant cells and is responsible for photosynthesis, the process of converting light energy into chemical energy.
