Here's an example of how you can set a security alert notification saying 'Motion detected':

```json
{
  "function": "set_notification",
  "type": "security",
  "message": "Motion detected"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to be executed as `set_notification`, the type of notification as `security`, and the message to be displayed as 'Motion detected'.
