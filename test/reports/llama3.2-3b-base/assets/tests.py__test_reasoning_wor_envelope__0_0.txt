To solve this, let's break down the clues:

1. The word starts with 'e'.
2. The word ends with 'e'.
3. The word contains one letter.

Considering the third clue, "contains one letter," I'm going to take a guess that the word is "an". It starts with 'e', ends with 'e', and contains only one letter, which is 'a'.
