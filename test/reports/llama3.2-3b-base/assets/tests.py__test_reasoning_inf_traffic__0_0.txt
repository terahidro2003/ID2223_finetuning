There could be several bottlenecks causing the website to load slowly only during business hours. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Network congestion**: During business hours, more users are accessing the website, which can lead to increased network congestion. This can be caused by a large number of concurrent users, high traffic, or a lack of bandwidth.
2. **Server overload**: The server may be experiencing an overload of requests, causing it to slow down or become unresponsive. This can be due to a surge in traffic, high CPU usage, or insufficient resources.
3. **Database queries**: If the website relies on a database to store and retrieve data, the database queries may be slowing down the website. This can be caused by a large number of concurrent requests, high query volumes, or inefficient database indexing.
4. **Content delivery network (CDN) issues**: If the website uses a CDN to distribute content, issues with the CDN can cause slow loading times. This can be due to a lack of caching, high latency, or poor CDN configuration.
5. **Bandwidth limitations**: If the website is hosted on a shared hosting plan or has limited bandwidth, it may not be able to handle the increased traffic during business hours.
6. **Resource-intensive scripts**: If the website relies on resource-intensive scripts, such as video or image processing, these scripts may be slowing down the website during business hours.
7. **Database indexing**: Poor database indexing can cause slow query performance, leading to slow website loading times.
8. **Server-side rendering**: If the website uses server-side rendering (SSR), it may be causing slow loading times due to the additional processing required.
9. **Third-party services**: If the website relies on third-party services, such as APIs or third-party libraries, issues with these services can cause slow loading times.
10. **Network latency**: High network latency can cause slow loading times, especially if the website is hosted in a different geographic location.

To identify the bottleneck, you can try the following:

* Monitor website performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, New Relic, or Splunk.
* Analyze server logs to identify any errors or issues.
* Use tools like Wireshark or Tcpdump to analyze network traffic.
* Test website performance during different times of the day to identify any patterns.
* Use debugging tools to identify specific issues with scripts, databases, or third-party services.

By identifying the bottleneck, you can take steps to optimize the website's performance and reduce loading times.
