To answer this question, I'll break it down into steps.

First, I need to identify what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Next, I need to think of a 4-letter palindrome that means to observe or notice. 

One possible 4-letter palindrome that fits this description is "SEEs". However, "SEEs" is not a commonly used word.

A more common 4-letter palindrome that fits this description is "SEES". 

Final Answer: SEES.
