This is a classic riddle. Let's break it down step by step.

The riddle states that you have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, and water but no fish. This suggests that the answer is not a physical location or a living thing, but rather a concept or an abstraction.

Cities, forests, and water are all physical entities that can be found in the world. However, the absence of houses, trees, and fish implies that the answer is not a physical location, but rather a representation or a metaphor for these concepts.

One possible interpretation is that the answer is a map. Maps typically represent cities, forests, and water, but they do not contain houses, trees, or fish. This fits the description in the riddle.

Another possible interpretation is that the answer is a diagram or a chart. Diagrams and charts can represent cities, forests, and water, but they do not contain houses, trees, or fish.

However, the most common and intuitive answer to this riddle is that the answer is a map.

Final Answer: A map.
