To determine which layer of the OSI model is responsible for routing, let's briefly consider the functions of each layer:

A) Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between devices. It provides error-checking and correction, and ensures that data is delivered in the correct order.

B) Network Layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. It provides logical addressing, routing, and congestion control.

C) Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data between two devices on the same network. It provides error-checking and correction, and ensures that data is delivered in the correct order.

D) Application Layer: This layer is responsible for providing services to end-user applications, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.

Based on these functions, the layer responsible for routing is the Network Layer.

Final Answer: B
