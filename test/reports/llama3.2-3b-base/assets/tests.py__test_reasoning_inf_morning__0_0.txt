There are several possible reasons why the coffee shop might be nearly empty at 2 PM, despite having a long line at 8 AM on Monday:

1. **Lunch rush**: Many people take their lunch break around 12-1 PM, so the coffee shop might be empty after the lunch rush.
2. **Monday blues**: Mondays are often considered the worst day of the week, and people might be less inclined to visit the coffee shop on a Monday morning.
3. **Weekend hangover**: Some people might be recovering from a weekend of heavy drinking or partying, and the coffee shop might not be their first choice for a Monday morning pick-me-up.
4. **Alternative coffee shops**: There might be other coffee shops in the area that are more popular or convenient for people, so they might be choosing to go there instead.
5. **Work schedule**: Some people might be working non-traditional hours, such as night shifts or flexible schedules, which could affect their coffee shop habits.
6. **Personal preferences**: Some people might not be coffee drinkers or might prefer a different type of beverage, such as tea or juice.
7. **Seasonal factors**: If the coffee shop is located in a region with a strong winter season, people might be less inclined to visit the coffee shop on a Monday morning when it's cold and dark outside.

These are just a few possible explanations, and there might be other factors at play as well.
