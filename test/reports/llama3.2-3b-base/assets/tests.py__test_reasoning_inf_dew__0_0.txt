The most likely explanation for the wet ground is that it may have been watered with a hose or a sprinkler system earlier in the day, but since you mentioned no sprinklers were on, it's possible that someone used a hose to water the lawn or a nearby area.

Another possibility is that there was a leak or a burst pipe somewhere in the area, which could have caused the water to seep into the ground.

However, if there's no recent watering or pipe issues, it's also possible that the ground is simply saturated with water from a nearby source, such as a nearby storm drain, a flooded area, or even a hidden underground water source.

But the most likely explanation, considering it didn't rain and no sprinklers were on, is that someone used a hose to water the lawn or a nearby area, and the water may have seeped into the ground, causing it to be wet.
