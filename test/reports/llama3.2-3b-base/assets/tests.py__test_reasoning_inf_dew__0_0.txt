To determine the most likely explanation for the wet field, let's consider the given information:

1. The field is filled with grass.
2. The field is wet.
3. It didn't rain last night.
4. No sprinklers were on.

Here are a few possible explanations:

1. **Dew**: Although it didn't rain, dew can still accumulate on the grass, making it wet. This is especially common in the early morning hours.
2. **Water from a nearby source**: There might be a nearby water source, such as a stream, pond, or even a leaky pipe, that could be seeping water onto the field.
3. **Irrigation system**: Although no sprinklers were on, it's possible that the field has an irrigation system that was activated before the night, or there might be a hidden or old irrigation system that was still operational.
4. **Flooding**: If the field is located in a low-lying area or near a body of water, it's possible that the field was flooded, either naturally or due to human activities.

Considering these possibilities, the most likely explanation for the wet field is **dew**, as it's a common occurrence and doesn't require any external water source.

Final Answer: Dew.
