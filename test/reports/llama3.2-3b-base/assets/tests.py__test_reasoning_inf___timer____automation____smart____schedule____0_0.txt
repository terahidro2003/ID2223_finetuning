To determine the system being used by the neighbor's house lights, let's consider the possible options:

1. **Timed Lighting System**: This system would involve a timer that controls the lighting schedule. However, the lights turning on and off at different times each evening doesn't seem to fit with a traditional timed lighting system.

2. **Smart Home System**: This system would involve a smart home hub, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, that can be controlled remotely. The lights could be programmed to turn on and off at different times, but this would require the neighbor to have a smart home system and a compatible device.

3. **Vacation Mode or Automated Lighting System**: Some smart home systems have a vacation mode or automated lighting system that can be programmed to turn lights on and off at different times while the occupants are away.

4. **Manual Control with a Timer**: The neighbor could be using a manual control with a timer, but this would require them to manually adjust the timer each evening, which doesn't seem to fit with the lights turning on and off at different times.

Considering these options, the most likely explanation is that the neighbor is using a **Vacation Mode or Automated Lighting System**. This system would allow them to program the lights to turn on and off at different times while they're away on vacation.

Final Answer: Vacation Mode or Automated Lighting System.
