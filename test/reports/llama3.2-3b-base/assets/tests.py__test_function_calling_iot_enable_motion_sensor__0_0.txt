Here's the JSON output for enabling the motion sensor in the hallway with a sensitivity of 8:

```json
{
  "function": "enable_motion_sensor",
  "sensor_id": "hallway_sensor",
  "sensitivity": 8
}
```

In this example, the `sensor_id` is assumed to be "hallway_sensor". You can replace it with the actual ID of the motion sensor you want to enable.
