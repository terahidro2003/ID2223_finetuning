Here's an example of how you can use the `get_trending_topics` function to get trending topics in the United States, limited to 15:

```json
{
  "function": "get_trending_topics",
  "location": "United States",
  "limit": 15
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to call, the location ("United States"), and the limit (15) for the trending topics.
