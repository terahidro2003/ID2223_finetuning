Here's an example of how you can configure logging for the payment-service at the INFO level with 90-day retention using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "configure_logging",
  "service": "payment-service",
  "level": "INFO",
  "retention_days": 90
}
```

This JSON object calls the `configure_logging` function with the following parameters:

- `service`: The name of the service, which is `payment-service`.
- `level`: The logging level, which is `INFO`.
- `retention_days`: The number of days to retain log files, which is 90.

This configuration will enable logging at the INFO level for the payment-service and retain log files for 90 days.
