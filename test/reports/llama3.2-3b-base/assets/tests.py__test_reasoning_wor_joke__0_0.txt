To solve this riddle, let's analyze each option given:

1. Cracked: This could refer to cracking a joke or a puzzle, but it's not a common verb for the word we're looking for.
2. Made: This is a possible option, as the word we're looking for could be something that can be created or manufactured.
3. Told: This option suggests that the word we're looking for is related to storytelling or communication.
4. Played: This option implies that the word we're looking for is related to entertainment or games.

Considering these options, a possible answer is a "joke." A joke can be:
- Cracked (as in, cracking a joke), which means to tell a joke or make people laugh.
- Made (as in, making a joke), which means to create or manufacture a joke.
- Told (as in, telling a joke), which means to share a joke with others.
- Played (as in, playing a joke), which means to trick or deceive someone.

Final Answer: A joke.
