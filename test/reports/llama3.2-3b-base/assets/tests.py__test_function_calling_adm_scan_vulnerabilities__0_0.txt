Here's an example of how you can implement the `scan_vulnerabilities` function in Python:

```python
import requests
import json
import time

def scan_vulnerabilities(target, scan_type):
    """
    Scans the web-server for full vulnerabilities.

    Args:
        target (str): The target web-server IP address or domain name.
        scan_type (str): The type of scan to perform (e.g., 'full', 'partial').

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the scan results.
    """
    # Set up the API endpoint and headers
    url = f"https://{target}/vulnerabilities"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    # Set up the payload for the request
    payload = {
        "scan_type": scan_type,
        "scan_target": target
    }

    # Send the request to the API endpoint
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the JSON response
        data = json.loads(response.text)
        return data
    else:
        # Return an error message if the request was not successful
        return {"error": "Failed to scan vulnerabilities"}

# Example usage:
target = "192.168.1.100"
scan_type = "full"
results = scan_vulnerabilities(target, scan_type)
print(results)
```

This function sends a POST request to the `/vulnerabilities` endpoint of the web-server, passing in the `scan_type` and `scan_target` parameters. The response from the API endpoint is then parsed as JSON and returned as a dictionary.

Please note that you should replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

Also, this is a basic example and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case.

**Note:** This is a hypothetical example and you should not use it in production without proper testing and validation.

**Security Considerations:**

* Always validate the input parameters to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
* Use a secure connection (HTTPS) to encrypt the data transmitted between the client and server.
* Use a secure API key and store it securely.
* Regularly update and patch the web-server to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
