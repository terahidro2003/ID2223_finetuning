To get driving directions from Central Station to Airport, I'll use the `get_directions` function. Here's the JSON request:

```json
{
  "function": "get_directions",
  "from": "Central Station",
  "to": "Airport",
  "mode": "driving"
}
```

Please note that you should replace "Central Station" and "Airport" with the actual names of the locations you want to travel from and to.
