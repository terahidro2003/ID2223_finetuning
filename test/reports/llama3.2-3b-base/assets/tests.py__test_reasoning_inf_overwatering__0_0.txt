There are several possible reasons why a plant's leaves are turning yellow despite regular watering. Here are some common causes:

1. **Overwatering**: Although you mentioned regular watering, it's possible that the soil is waterlogged, causing the roots to rot. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger in it, and make sure it's not waterlogged.
2. **Underwatering**: On the other hand, the plant might be underwatered, especially during hot or dry weather. Check the soil moisture again, and consider increasing the frequency of watering.
3. **Nutrient deficiency**: Yellow leaves can be a sign of a nutrient deficiency, such as nitrogen, iron, or magnesium. Fertilize the plant with a balanced fertilizer to see if that resolves the issue.
4. **Too much direct sunlight**: If the plant is exposed to direct sunlight for too long, it can cause the leaves to become scorched and turn yellow. Consider moving the plant to a spot with filtered sunlight.
5. **Root bound**: If the plant has outgrown its container and needs more room to grow, the leaves may turn yellow. Consider transplanting the plant into a larger container.
6. **Pests or diseases**: Pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites can cause yellow leaves. Check the plant for any signs of infestation, and treat accordingly. Fungal diseases like leaf spot or powdery mildew can also cause yellow leaves. Inspect the plant for any signs of disease, and treat with a fungicide if necessary.
7. **Temperature fluctuations**: If the plant is exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations, it can cause the leaves to turn yellow. Keep the plant in a spot with a consistent temperature between 65°F to 75°F (18°C to 24°C).
8. **Soil pH imbalance**: If the soil pH is too high or too low, it can cause nutrient deficiencies, leading to yellow leaves. Check the soil pH and adjust it if necessary.
9. **Transplant shock**: If the plant has recently been transplanted, it may be experiencing transplant shock, which can cause yellow leaves. Give the plant time to adjust, and provide it with plenty of water and nutrients.
10. **Aging leaves**: As leaves age, they naturally turn yellow and fall off. If the yellow leaves are at the edges of the plant, it might be a normal part of the plant's life cycle.

To troubleshoot the issue, inspect the plant carefully and consider the following steps:

* Check the soil moisture and adjust watering accordingly.
* Inspect the plant for pests or diseases.
* Fertilize the plant with a balanced fertilizer.
* Prune any yellow or damaged leaves to prevent the spread of disease.
* Provide the plant with a balanced environment, including temperature, humidity, and light.

If the issue persists, consider consulting with a gardening expert or taking a sample of the plant to a nursery for further diagnosis.
