Here's how you can scale the 'price' and 'quantity' features using a standard scaler in the ML data toolkit:

```json
{
  "function": "feature_scaling",
  "features": ["price", "quantity"],
  "scaler": "standard"
}
```

This JSON object specifies that you want to scale the 'price' and 'quantity' features using a standard scaler. The `standard` scaler is a type of scaler that subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation for each feature.
