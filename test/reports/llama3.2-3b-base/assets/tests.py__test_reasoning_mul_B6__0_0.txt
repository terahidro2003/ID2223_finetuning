To answer this question, let's analyze each option:

A) Queue: A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.

B) Stack: A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed.

C) Array: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It does not inherently follow a LIFO or FIFO order.

D) Tree: A tree is a hierarchical data structure, and it does not follow a specific order of removal.

Considering the options, the correct answer is B) Stack, as it is the only one that uses LIFO.

Final Answer: B) Stack
