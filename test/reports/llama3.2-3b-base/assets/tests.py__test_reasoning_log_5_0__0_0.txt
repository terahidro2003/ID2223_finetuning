To solve this problem, let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns. Let's say the cost of the ball is x cents. Since the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the cost of the bat is (x + 100) cents.

We know that the total cost of the bat and ball together is $1.10, which is equivalent to 110 cents. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 100) = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 100 = 110

Subtract 100 from both sides:

2x = 10

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 5

So, the ball costs 5 cents.

Final Answer: 5
