To determine the likely cause of the moldy bread, let's consider the factors that could contribute to mold growth on the bread.

1. Temperature: Mold thrives in warm temperatures. Since the bread was bought only 2 days ago, it's likely that the storage conditions were not ideal, possibly with a warm environment.

2. Humidity: Mold also requires a certain level of humidity to grow. If the storage area was too humid, it could have created an ideal environment for mold to develop.

3. Contamination: Although the bread was bought only 2 days ago, it's possible that the mold was introduced during the packaging or transportation process.

Considering these factors, a likely cause of the moldy bread is improper storage conditions, possibly with high temperatures and humidity. 

Final Answer: Poor storage conditions.
