There are several likely causes for a faster-draining phone battery than usual, even if you haven't changed any settings. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Software updates**: New software updates can sometimes cause battery drain issues. Check for any recent updates and see if installing them resolves the issue.
2. **Resource-intensive apps**: Certain apps, such as games, video editors, or social media apps, can consume more power than usual. Try closing or limiting the use of these apps to see if it improves battery life.
3. **Location services and GPS**: If your phone is using location services or GPS, it can drain the battery faster. Try disabling these features or limiting their use to see if it improves battery life.
4. **Background apps**: Some apps may be running in the background and consuming power even when you're not actively using them. Check your phone's battery usage to identify any suspicious apps.
5. **Screen brightness and auto-brightness**: If your screen brightness is set too high or if the auto-brightness feature is enabled, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Try adjusting the screen brightness or disabling auto-brightness to see if it improves battery life.
6. **Network activity**: If your phone is connected to a cellular network or Wi-Fi, it can consume power. Try turning off cellular data or Wi-Fi when not in use to see if it improves battery life.
7. **Hardware issues**: In some cases, a faster-draining battery can be caused by a hardware issue, such as a faulty battery or a malfunctioning charging port. If you've tried the above steps and the issue persists, it may be worth contacting your phone's manufacturer for further assistance.
8. **Age and wear**: As your phone's battery ages, it can become less efficient and drain faster. If your phone is several years old, it may be experiencing battery degradation.
9. **Charging habits**: If you're charging your phone too frequently or for extended periods, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Try to charge your phone less frequently or use a power bank to charge it on the go.

By checking these potential causes, you may be able to identify the reason for your phone's faster-draining battery and take steps to improve its performance.
