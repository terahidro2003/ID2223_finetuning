To solve this problem, we need to first determine the rate at which the cats catch mice. 

5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes. This means that 1 cat catches 1 mouse in 5 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many mice 1 cat can catch in 100 minutes. Since 1 cat catches 1 mouse in 5 minutes, it will take 100 minutes for 1 cat to catch 20 mice (100 minutes / 5 minutes per mouse).

To catch 100 mice in 100 minutes, we need 5 cats (20 mice / 4 mice per cat).
