To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of cats, the number of mice, and the time.

In the given scenario, 5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes. This means that each cat catches 1 mouse in 5 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many cats are needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes. Since each cat catches 1 mouse in 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of cats needed as follows:

100 mice / 5 mice per cat = 20 cats

However, since we are also considering the time, we need to find out how many cats can catch 100 mice in 100 minutes. Since each cat takes 5 minutes to catch 1 mouse, we can calculate the number of cats needed as follows:

100 minutes / 5 minutes per cat = 20 cats

So, 20 cats are needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes.
