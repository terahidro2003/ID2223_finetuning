That's a clever play on words. However, the answer is not necessarily related to the color of the bricks. A greenhouse is typically made of transparent materials such as glass or plastic, which allow sunlight to enter and warm the plants inside. The color of the bricks used to build the house or other structures is not relevant to the composition of a greenhouse.
