To infer the situation, let's consider the context and the typical behavior of drivers.

1. Hazard lights are usually activated when a driver needs to alert other drivers to a situation that requires attention, such as a hazard, emergency, or a need for assistance.
2. The fact that the hazard lights are blinking suggests that the driver is trying to signal that the situation is not an immediate emergency, but rather a warning or a request for assistance.
3. The car is parked on the side of the highway, which implies that the driver is not in immediate danger or need for assistance, but rather is seeking help or information.

Considering these points, we can infer that the driver may be:

* Seeking assistance or help with a flat tire, breakdown, or other minor issue.
* Trying to alert other drivers to a hazard or obstruction on the road.
* Requesting help with a vehicle-related issue, such as a flat tire or a breakdown.
* Possibly stranded or lost, and seeking assistance to get back on the road.

Without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact situation, but these are some possible inferences that can be made based on the context.
