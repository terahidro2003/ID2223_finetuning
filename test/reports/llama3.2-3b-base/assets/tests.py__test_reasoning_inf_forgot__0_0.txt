There are several possible reasons why the office lights are on but nobody is there at 10 PM on a Sunday. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Maintenance or cleaning**: The office might be undergoing maintenance or cleaning, and the lights are left on to illuminate the space.
2. **Security**: The office might be equipped with security cameras or motion sensors that are still active, causing the lights to stay on.
3. **Utility company issue**: The utility company might be performing some work, such as a routine inspection or maintenance of the electrical system, and the lights are left on.
4. **Power outage**: Although it's 10 PM, there might have been a brief power outage earlier in the day, and the lights are still on as a result.
5. **Office building management**: The office building might have a management company that is responsible for maintaining the building's systems, including the lighting. They might be leaving the lights on to maintain a consistent environment.
6. **Emergency lighting**: The office might have emergency lighting systems that are designed to stay on in case of a power outage or other emergency situation.
7. **Preventative maintenance**: The office might be scheduled for preventative maintenance, such as a routine inspection of the electrical system, and the lights are left on to facilitate the work.

These are just a few possibilities, and there might be other reasons why the office lights are on but nobody is there.
