To determine the likely reason, let's consider the given information:

1. It's 10 PM on a Sunday, which means it's late at night and the weekend is over.
2. All the lights in the office are on, indicating that someone or something is using the office.

Considering these points, here are a few possibilities:

- The office might be a 24-hour business or a hub for late-night work or activities.
- It could be a temporary office or a space used for events, and the lights are left on for a specific purpose.
- Alternatively, it's possible that someone has been using the office for personal reasons, such as studying, working on a project, or attending to personal matters.

However, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason. But if I had to choose one possibility, I would say that the likely reason is that the office is being used for late-night work or activities, possibly by the office's employees or by someone who has been using the space for a specific purpose.

Final Answer: The office is being used for late-night work or activities.
