There could be several reasons why your phone battery is draining faster than usual. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Software updates**: Although you mentioned you haven't changed any settings, it's possible that a recent software update may have caused the battery drain. Sometimes, updates can introduce new features or bug fixes that consume more power.

2. **Background apps**: Even if you haven't downloaded any new apps, there might be existing apps running in the background that are consuming more power than usual. This could be due to a bug or an issue with the app itself.

3. **Location services**: If you've enabled location services for any apps, it could be causing the battery drain. Location services can consume a significant amount of power, especially if you're using them frequently.

4. **Screen brightness**: If your screen brightness is set too high, it can cause the battery to drain faster. Check if your screen brightness is set to its maximum level.

5. **Network activity**: If you're using a cellular network or Wi-Fi, it could be causing the battery drain. Check your data usage and network activity to see if it's exceeding your expected limits.

6. **Hardware issues**: In some cases, a hardware issue like a faulty charging port or a malfunctioning battery could be causing the battery drain.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:

- Check your battery usage and network activity to see if there are any unusual patterns.
- Disable any location services or background apps that you don't need.
- Adjust your screen brightness to a lower level.
- Check for any software updates and install them if necessary.
- If you suspect a hardware issue, try charging your phone for a longer period to see if the battery drain persists.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be worth contacting your phone manufacturer or a professional for further assistance.

Final Answer: It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more information, but these are some possible reasons why your phone battery is draining faster than usual.
