Here's an example of how you can send a critical notification to a Slack channel using the provided tools:

```json
{
  "function": "send_notification",
  "channel": "your-slack-channel",
  "message": "Database connection failed",
  "severity": "critical"
}
```

However, if you want to customize the notification message or add more details, you can modify the JSON as follows:

```json
{
  "function": "send_notification",
  "channel": "your-slack-channel",
  "message": "Database connection failed. Please investigate and take corrective action.",
  "severity": "critical"
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your-slack-channel"` with the actual name of your Slack channel.
