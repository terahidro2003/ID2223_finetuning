There are several possible systems that could be causing the lights to turn on and off at different times each evening. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Smart Home System**: The neighbor's house might be equipped with a smart home system, such as a hub like Samsung SmartThings, Wink, or Apple HomeKit. This system can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app, and it might be set to turn the lights on and off at different times to create the illusion of occupancy.
2. **Timed Lighting System**: The neighbor might have installed a timed lighting system, which is a type of smart lighting that can be programmed to turn on and off at specific times. This system can be controlled using a smartphone app or a physical keypad.
3. **Vacation Mode**: Some smart home systems and lighting controllers come with a "vacation mode" or "away mode" that can be activated when the homeowner is away. This mode can turn lights on and off at random intervals to create the illusion of occupancy.
4. **Automated Lighting System**: The neighbor might have installed an automated lighting system, such as a system that uses sensors to detect the time of day and turn lights on and off accordingly.
5. **Human Intervention**: It's also possible that the neighbor is simply turning the lights on and off at different times each evening to create the illusion of occupancy.

To determine the exact system being used, it would be helpful to observe the lights more closely and look for any clues, such as:

* A smartphone app or keypad nearby
* A smart home hub or controller
* A schedule or timer on the lights
* A sensor or motion detector nearby

If you're still unsure, you could try talking to your neighbor and asking them about the lights. They might be able to provide more information about the system they're using.
