Here's an example of how you can optimize the transactions table using the vacuum operation:

```json
{
  "function": "optimize_table",
  "table": "transactions",
  "operation": "vacuum"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to use (`optimize_table`), the table to optimize (`transactions`), and the operation to perform (`vacuum`). The `vacuum` operation will remove any dead tuples from the table, which can help improve query performance.
