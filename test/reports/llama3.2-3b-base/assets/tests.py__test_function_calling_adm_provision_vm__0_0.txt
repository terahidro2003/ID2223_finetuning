Here's an example of how you can provision a t3.large VM in us-west-2 with Ubuntu using the cloud resource manager:

```json
{
  "function": "provision_vm",
  "instance_type": "t3.large",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "os": "ubuntu"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to use to provision the VM, which is `provision_vm`.
- `instance_type`: The type of instance to use, which is `t3.large`.
- `region`: The region in which to provision the VM, which is `us-west-2`.
- `os`: The operating system to use, which is `ubuntu`.

When you call the `provision_vm` function with this JSON object, it will provision a new t3.large VM in the us-west-2 region with Ubuntu as the operating system.
