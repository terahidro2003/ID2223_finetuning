Children typically go through several stages of development, and the one that matches the description of asking "why" after every statement is likely the "Egocentric Stage" of cognitive development.

The Egocentric Stage is a stage of cognitive development that occurs in children between the ages of 2 and 7, with the peak age being around 4-5 years old. During this stage, children have difficulty taking other people's perspectives and tend to focus on their own thoughts and feelings. They often ask "why" to clarify their own understanding and to seek more information.

Another possible explanation is that the child is in the "Preoperational Stage" of cognitive development, which is also a stage of cognitive development that occurs in children between the ages of 2 and 7. During this stage, children are still developing their ability to think logically and may have difficulty with abstract thinking.

However, the Egocentric Stage is a more specific stage that is characterized by the child's tendency to ask "why" after every statement, which is a hallmark of this stage.

Final Answer: The child is likely in the Egocentric Stage of cognitive development.
