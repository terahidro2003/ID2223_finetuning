This is a classic riddle. To solve it, let's think about the phrase "the more you take, the more you leave behind." 

One possible interpretation is that the more steps you take, the more distance you cover, and the more you leave behind in terms of your starting point. However, this doesn't seem to fit the typical answer to this riddle.

Another possible interpretation is that the more you take (of something), the more you leave behind (of something else). For example, if you take more steps, you leave behind footprints. If you take more of a resource, you leave behind its scarcity.

Considering the common answer to this riddle, I'm going to take a guess that the answer is "footsteps." The more steps you take, the more footprints you leave behind.

Final Answer: footprints.
