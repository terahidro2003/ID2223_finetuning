To determine why the coffee shop is nearly empty at 2 PM, let's consider the typical daily routine of its customers.

1. Monday is a workday, and many people start their day with a cup of coffee from the coffee shop.
2. The line at 8 AM suggests that many customers are arriving at the shop to start their day with coffee.
3. However, as the day progresses, many customers will likely be at work, attending classes, or engaged in other activities that don't involve visiting the coffee shop.
4. The shop may also be closed during lunch breaks, which could further reduce the number of customers.
5. Additionally, some customers may have already had their morning coffee and are not in need of another cup.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the coffee shop is nearly empty at 2 PM because many of its regular customers are at work, and the shop is closed during lunch breaks.

Final Answer: Many customers are at work, and the shop is closed during lunch breaks.
