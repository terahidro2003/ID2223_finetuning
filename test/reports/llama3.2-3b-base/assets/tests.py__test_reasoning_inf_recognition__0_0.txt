To identify individual letters, a child needs to possess phonological awareness, which is the ability to hear and manipulate sounds in words. This skill is closely related to reading and writing abilities.

Phonological awareness involves recognizing and manipulating the individual sounds (phonemes) within words, such as identifying the sounds of letters in the alphabet song. The child in this scenario is able to recall the song, but lacks the ability to break down the sounds and identify individual letters.

Another related skill is orthographic awareness, which involves recognizing and remembering the written forms of letters and words. However, the primary skill the child is missing is phonological awareness.

Final Answer: Phonological awareness.
