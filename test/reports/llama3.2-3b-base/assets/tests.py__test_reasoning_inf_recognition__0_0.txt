The child is likely missing the skill of phonological awareness, specifically the ability to recognize and identify individual letters. Phonological awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate sounds in words, including individual letters and letter combinations.

In this case, the child knows the alphabet song, which implies they have some knowledge of the sequence of letters, but they are unable to identify individual letters. This suggests that they may need additional practice and instruction to develop their phonological awareness skills, particularly in recognizing and identifying letters.

Some strategies to help the child develop this skill include:

1. Singing the alphabet song multiple times and pointing to individual letters as you sing.
2. Using flashcards to show individual letters and having the child identify them.
3. Playing letter-matching games, such as matching uppercase and lowercase letters.
4. Using letter cards or foam letters to create a tactile experience.
5. Incorporating letter recognition into daily activities, such as reading books or singing songs that incorporate letter recognition.

By developing phonological awareness skills, the child will be better equipped to recognize and identify individual letters, which will help them to read and write more effectively.
