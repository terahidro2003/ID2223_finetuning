To find the result, we need to multiply all the numbers on a telephone dial pad. 

First, we multiply the numbers 1-9:
1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 = 362,880

Next, we multiply 0 by the result of the previous multiplication:
0 * 362,880 = 0

So, the result of multiplying all the numbers on a telephone dial pad is 0.
