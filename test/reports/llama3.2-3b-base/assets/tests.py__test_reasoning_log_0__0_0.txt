To find the result, we need to multiply all the numbers on a telephone dial pad (1-9 and 0).

First, let's multiply the numbers 1-9:
1 × 2 = 2
2 × 3 = 6
6 × 4 = 24
24 × 5 = 120
120 × 6 = 720
720 × 7 = 5040
5040 × 8 = 40320
40320 × 9 = 362880

Now, let's multiply 0 by each of these results:
0 × 362880 = 0
0 × 40320 = 0
0 × 5040 = 0
0 × 720 = 0
0 × 120 = 0
0 × 24 = 0
0 × 6 = 0
0 × 2 = 0

The final result is 0.
