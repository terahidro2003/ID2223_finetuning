To determine the event that likely happened or is expected, let's analyze the situation.

The grocery store is out of milk, eggs, and bread. These are essential items for a typical household, and their absence suggests a high demand or a shortage.

One possible explanation is that a holiday or special event is approaching, such as Easter, Thanksgiving, or a weekend when many people are planning to cook and bake. In this case, the store's inventory might have been depleted due to increased demand.

Another possibility is that a severe weather event, such as a storm or a heatwave, has caused a shortage of these items. For example, if a storm has knocked out power lines or disrupted transportation, it might be difficult for the store to receive new shipments of milk, eggs, and bread.

However, without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. But based on the items listed, a holiday or special event is a more likely explanation.

Final Answer: A holiday or special event is likely the cause of the shortage.
