Here's the JSON request to search hotels in Berlin:

```json
{
  "function": "search_hotels",
  "location": "Berlin",
  "checkin": "2024-12-20",
  "checkout": "2024-12-25",
  "guests": 2
}
```

I'll now use the `search_hotels` function to find hotels in Berlin for the specified dates and number of guests. 

Please note that I'm a travel information agent, not a real API, so I'll simulate the response. The actual response may vary based on the hotel availability and other factors.

Here's a simulated response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Hotel Berlin",
      "address": "Kurfürstendamm 34, 10785 Berlin, Germany",
      "price": 150,
      "rating": 4.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Hotel Europa",
      "address": "Eisenacher Straße 10, 10178 Berlin, Germany",
      "price": 120,
      "rating": 4.2
    },
    {
      "name": "Hotel Berliner Hof",
      "address": "Berliner Straße 20, 10117 Berlin, Germany",
      "price": 180,
      "rating": 4.8
    }
  ]
}
```

This response includes three hotels in Berlin that match the specified criteria. The prices and ratings are simulated and may vary based on the actual hotel availability and other factors.
