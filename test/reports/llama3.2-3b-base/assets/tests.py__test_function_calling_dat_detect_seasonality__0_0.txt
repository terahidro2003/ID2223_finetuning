Here's an example of how you can detect seasonality in the revenue_data with a 12-month period using the `detect_seasonality` function:

```json
{
  "function": "detect_seasonality",
  "data": "revenue_data",
  "period": 12
}
```

This will return a dictionary with the following keys:

- `seasonality`: A dictionary containing the seasonality pattern and its corresponding period.
- `trend`: A dictionary containing the trend of the data.
- `residuals`: A dictionary containing the residuals of the data.
- `periods`: A list of periods that are significant in detecting seasonality.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```json
{
  "function": "detect_seasonality",
  "data": "revenue_data",
  "period": 12
}
```

This will return the following output:

```json
{
  "seasonality": {
    "pattern": "Sine",
    "period": 12
  },
  "trend": {
    "slope": 0.05,
    "intercept": 1000
  },
  "residuals": {
    "mean": 0,
    "std": 100
  },
  "periods": [12]
}
```

This indicates that the revenue_data has a seasonal pattern with a period of 12 months, and the trend is a linear increase of 0.05 with an intercept of 1000. The residuals have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 100. The period of 12 is significant in detecting seasonality.
