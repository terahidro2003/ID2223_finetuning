To determine the largest mammal on Earth, we need to consider the average adult weight and length of each option.

African Elephant: The average adult weight is around 5,000-14,000 pounds (2,268-6,350 kilograms), and the average length is around 8-13 feet (2.4-4 meters).

Blue Whale: The average adult weight is around 150-170 tons (136,000-152,000 kilograms), and the average length is around 82-100 feet (25-30 meters).

Giraffe: The average adult weight is around 1,100-2,800 pounds (500-1,270 kilograms), and the average length is around 14-19 feet (4.3-5.8 meters).

Polar Bear: The average adult weight is around 700-1,700 pounds (318-771 kilograms), and the average length is around 7-9 feet (2.1-2.7 meters).

Considering these values, the Blue Whale is significantly larger than the other options, with a much greater weight and length.

Final Answer: The Blue Whale.
