To explain this pattern, let's break down the information provided.

1. The gym parking lot is full at 6 AM, which means that at 6 AM, all available parking spaces are occupied.
2. At noon (12 PM), the parking lot is half-empty, which means that half of the available parking spaces are occupied.

This pattern suggests that the gym has a steady stream of visitors throughout the day, but the number of visitors decreases as the day progresses.

Here are a few possible explanations for this pattern:

- The gym has a morning rush hour, where a large number of visitors arrive at 6 AM to work out or attend classes. This rush hour continues until around 9-10 AM, when the number of visitors decreases.
- The gym has a lunchtime rush hour, where a large number of visitors arrive at noon to work out or attend classes. This rush hour continues until around 1-2 PM, when the number of visitors decreases.
- The gym has a combination of morning and lunchtime rush hours, with a steady stream of visitors throughout the day.

These are just a few possible explanations for the pattern. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the pattern.

Final Answer: The gym has a combination of morning and lunchtime rush hours, with a steady stream of visitors throughout the day.
