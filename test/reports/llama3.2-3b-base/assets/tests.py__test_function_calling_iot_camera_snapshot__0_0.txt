Here's an example of how you can use the `camera_snapshot` function to take a high-quality snapshot from the `front_door` camera:

```json
{
  "function": "camera_snapshot",
  "camera_id": "front_door",
  "quality": "high"
}
```

This will send a request to the IoT device manager to take a high-quality snapshot from the `front_door` camera. The output will likely be a base64-encoded image string, which you can then use as needed.
