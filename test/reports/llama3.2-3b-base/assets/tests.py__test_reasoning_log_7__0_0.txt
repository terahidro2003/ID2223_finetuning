To find out how many more books can fit, we need to first calculate the total capacity of the bookshelf. 

Since there are 5 shelves and each shelf can hold 7 books, the total capacity is 5 * 7 = 35 books.

We already have 28 books on the shelves, so we need to subtract this from the total capacity to find out how many more books can fit.

35 (total capacity) - 28 (books already on the shelves) = 7

Therefore, 7 more books can fit on the shelves.
