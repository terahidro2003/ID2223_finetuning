Here's how you can filter the orders table where the status equals 'completed' using the `filter_records` function:

```json
{
  "function": "filter_records",
  "table": "orders",
  "condition": "status = 'completed'"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the `filter_records` function to be applied to the `orders` table, with the condition that the `status` column should be equal to 'completed'.
