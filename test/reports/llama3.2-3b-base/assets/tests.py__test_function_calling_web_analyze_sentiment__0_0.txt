Here's an example of how you can analyze the sentiment of the text 'This product is amazing!' using the VaderSentiment model in Python:

```python
import json
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def analyze_sentiment(text, model):
    """
    Analyzes the sentiment of a given text using the specified model.

    Args:
        text (str): The text to analyze.
        model (str): The sentiment model to use.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the sentiment scores.
    """
    if model == "vader":
        # Initialize the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
        sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
        
        # Analyze the sentiment of the text
        sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)
        
        # Return the sentiment scores
        return sentiment_scores
    else:
        # If the model is not recognized, return an error message
        return {"error": "Model not recognized"}

# Example usage
text = "This product is amazing!"
model = "vader"

sentiment_scores = analyze_sentiment(text, model)

print("Sentiment Scores:")
print(f"  - Positive: {sentiment_scores['pos']:.2f}")
print(f"  - Negative: {sentiment_scores['neg']:.2f}")
print(f"  - Neutral: {sentiment_scores['neu']:.2f}")
print(f"  - Compound: {sentiment_scores['compound']:.2f}")
```

This code defines a function `analyze_sentiment` that takes a text and a model as input, analyzes the sentiment of the text using the specified model, and returns a dictionary containing the sentiment scores. The function uses the `nltk` library to access the VaderSentiment model.

In the example usage, we analyze the sentiment of the text 'This product is amazing!' using the VaderSentiment model and print the sentiment scores.

Note that the sentiment scores are calculated as follows:

*   Positive: The proportion of text that falls in the positive sentiment category.
*   Negative: The proportion of text that falls in the negative sentiment category.
*   Neutral: The proportion of text that falls in the neutral sentiment category.
*   Compound: A measure of the overall sentiment of the text, ranging from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive).
