To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of machines and the time it takes to make widgets.

If 5 machines can make 5 widgets in 5 minutes, it means that each machine can make 1 widget in 5 minutes.

Now, if we have 100 machines, it will take each machine 5 minutes to make 1 widget. Since there are 100 machines, it will take 100 machines 5 minutes to make 100 widgets.

So, the answer is 5 minutes.
