To determine the cause of the book's yellowing and brittleness, let's consider the factors that can contribute to these changes.

1. **Light exposure**: Direct sunlight or UV rays can cause the paper to degrade, leading to yellowing and brittleness. This is because UV radiation breaks down the cellulose fibers in the paper, causing it to weaken and become brittle.

2. **Moisture**: High humidity or exposure to water can also cause paper to yellow and become brittle. When paper absorbs moisture, the cellulose fibers can swell, leading to a breakdown in the paper's structure.

3. **Aging**: As paper ages, it naturally undergoes a process called "gelatinization," where the cellulose fibers break down and become more brittle.

4. **Handling and storage**: Physical stress, such as bending, folding, or stacking, can cause paper to become brittle and yellow.

Considering the book was kept indoors, it's likely that the yellowing and brittleness are due to one or more of these factors.

However, since the book was kept indoors, it's less likely to be due to direct sunlight or UV rays. 

The most likely cause is the **aging process**. As the book has been kept indoors, it has simply aged over time, causing the paper to yellow and become brittle.

Final Answer: The aging process is the most likely cause of the book's yellowing and brittleness.
