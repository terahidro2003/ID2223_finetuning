To calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that no two people share a birthday.

There are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For the first person, there are 365 possible birthdays. For the second person, there are 364 possible birthdays (since one birthday is already taken). For the third person, there are 363 possible birthdays, and so on.

The probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365/365 = 1. The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364/365. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two people) is 363/365, and so on.

We can multiply these probabilities together to get the probability that all 23 people have unique birthdays:

(365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (365-22)/365

This is a product of 23 terms, and it can be simplified to:

(365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (43/365)

Using a calculator or software, we can approximate this product to be around 0.4927.

Since the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is the complement of this probability, we can subtract it from 1 to get:

1 - 0.4927 ≈ 0.5073

So, the probability that at least two people share a birthday in a group of 23 people is approximately 50.73%, which is more than 50%.
