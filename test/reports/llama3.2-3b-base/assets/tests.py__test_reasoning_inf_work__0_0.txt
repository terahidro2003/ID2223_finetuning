There are several possible explanations for this pattern:

1. **Peak morning hours**: The gym is likely busiest during the morning hours, around 6-8 AM, when people are commuting to work or school. This is a common time for people to exercise before their day begins.
2. **Lunchtime drop-off**: At noon, people may be dropping off their children at school or daycare, and then heading to the gym to exercise before their day begins. This can lead to a temporary decrease in parking lot usage.
3. **Afternoon slump**: Afternoon hours, around 2-4 PM, may see a decrease in gym usage as people take a break from their exercise routine or are busy with other activities.
4. **Weekend vs. weekday usage**: If the gym is busier on weekdays, it's possible that weekend usage is lower, leading to a half-empty parking lot at noon on weekends.
5. **Special events or classes**: The gym may be hosting special events or classes, such as yoga or Pilates, which can attract a smaller crowd during the day.
6. **Membership patterns**: The gym's membership patterns may be skewed towards morning and evening hours, with a lull in usage during the middle of the day.

To better understand the pattern, it would be helpful to know more about the gym's usage patterns, such as:

* What time of day is the gym busiest?
* Are there any specific days of the week or months when the gym is busier?
* Are there any special events or classes that may be affecting usage?
* What is the gym's membership demographic, and are there any patterns in their usage habits?

By gathering more information, it may be possible to identify the underlying cause of the pattern and make adjustments to improve the gym's parking lot usage.
