To find the result of 2^10, we need to calculate 2 multiplied by itself 10 times.

2^1 = 2
2^2 = 2 * 2 = 4
2^3 = 2 * 4 = 8
2^4 = 2 * 8 = 16
2^5 = 2 * 16 = 32
2^6 = 2 * 32 = 64
2^7 = 2 * 64 = 128
2^8 = 2 * 128 = 256
2^9 = 2 * 256 = 512
2^10 = 2 * 512 = 1024

Therefore, the result of 2^10 is 1024. 

Final Answer: 1024
