There are several possible reasons why a movie theater might be packed on a rainy Saturday afternoon:

1. **Escape from the rain**: People might be seeking a dry and cozy place to escape the rain and spend a relaxing afternoon indoors.
2. **Movie marathon**: The theater might be showing a series of movies, such as a franchise or a popular series, that fans are eager to see. This could be a popular choice for a rainy day.
3. **New release**: A new movie might be released on that Saturday, and people are eager to see it on the big screen.
4. **Special event**: The theater might be hosting a special event, such as a Q&A session with the cast, a behind-the-scenes look, or a themed party, which is attracting a large crowd.
5. **Family outing**: A rainy Saturday is a great excuse for families to spend time together indoors, and a movie theater is a convenient and fun destination for a family outing.
6. **Sports or concert event**: The theater might be hosting a sports game or a concert, which is drawing a large crowd.
7. **Holiday weekend**: If the rainy Saturday falls during a holiday weekend, such as a Presidents' Day or Memorial Day weekend, people might be seeking indoor activities to avoid the rain and enjoy some holiday cheer.

These are just a few possibilities, but there could be other reasons why the movie theater is packed on that rainy Saturday afternoon.
