There are several factors that could contribute to a book's pages becoming yellowed and brittle, even if it's been kept indoors. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Age**: As books get older, the paper they're printed on can break down over time, causing the pages to yellow and become brittle. This is a natural process, but it can be accelerated by exposure to light, moisture, and other environmental factors.
2. **Light exposure**: Ultraviolet (UV) light from sunlight or artificial sources can cause the paper to degrade, leading to yellowing and brittleness. This is especially true for books that are exposed to direct sunlight or have UV-emitting lamps nearby.
3. **Moisture**: High humidity or water damage can cause the paper to become soggy and brittle. This can happen if the book is exposed to condensation, flooding, or other forms of moisture.
4. **Handling and wear**: Physical handling of the book, such as turning pages or storing it in a tight space, can cause wear and tear on the paper. This can lead to yellowing and brittleness over time.
5. **Ink and pigment degradation**: The ink and pigments used in printing can break down over time, causing the text and images to fade or become discolored. This can lead to yellowing and brittleness.
6. **Acidic or alkaline conditions**: The pH level of the paper can affect its stability. If the paper is acidic or alkaline, it can cause the pages to yellow and become brittle.
7. **Storage conditions**: The way a book is stored can also affect its condition. For example, storing a book in a humid or damp environment can cause the paper to become soggy and brittle.

To slow down the degradation process, you can try to:

* Store the book in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
* Use acid-free tissue paper or bookends to support the book and prevent it from becoming bent or creased.
* Handle the book gently and avoid touching the pages.
* Consider using a book conservator or restorer to assess and treat the book if necessary.

Keep in mind that some degree of yellowing and brittleness is normal for old books, but excessive degradation can be a sign of more serious problems.
