Here's an example of how you can use the `search_videos` function to search for Python programming videos with long duration and HD quality:

```json
{
  "function": "search_videos",
  "query": "Python programming",
  "duration": "long",
  "quality": "HD"
}
```

This will return a list of videos that match the specified criteria. You can then use the `find_podcasts` function to filter the results and get the video titles, descriptions, and other relevant information.

Alternatively, you can also use the following JSON object to search for Python programming videos with long duration and HD quality:

```json
{
  "function": "search_videos",
  "query": "Python programming",
  "duration": ["long", "long", "long"],
  "quality": ["HD", "HD", "HD"]
}
```

This will return a list of videos that match the specified duration and quality criteria.

Note that the `duration` and `quality` parameters can be specified as arrays, which allows you to filter the results based on multiple criteria.
