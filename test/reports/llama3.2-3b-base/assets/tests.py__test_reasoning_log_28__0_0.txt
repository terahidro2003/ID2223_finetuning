To solve this problem, let's break it down into daily progress.

The snail climbs 3 feet up each day, but slides back 2 feet at night. So, the net progress each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot.

Since the well is 30 feet deep, the snail needs to make 30 feet of progress to reach the top.

To find out how many days it will take, we can divide the total depth (30 feet) by the net progress each day (1 foot):

30 feet / 1 foot/day = 30 days

So, it will take the snail 30 days to reach the top of the 30-foot well.
