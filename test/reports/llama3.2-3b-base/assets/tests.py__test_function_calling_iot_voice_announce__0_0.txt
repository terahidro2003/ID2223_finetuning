Here's an example of how you can use the `voice_announce` function to make an announcement in the kitchen and dining room:

```json
{
  "function": "voice_announce",
  "message": "Dinner is ready",
  "rooms": [
    "kitchen",
    "dining room"
  ]
}
```

This JSON object specifies the function to be executed as `voice_announce`, the message to be announced as "Dinner is ready", and the rooms where the announcement should be made as a list containing "kitchen" and "dining room".
