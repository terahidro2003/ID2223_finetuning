To find the common English word with the letters 'kst' together, I'll try to think of words that fit. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Kestrel - a type of bird
2. Kest - a unit of time
3. Kestrel - another type of bird
4. Kest - a unit of time
5. Kestrel - a type of bird

After trying a few options, I think I've found a word that fits: 'Kestrel'.
