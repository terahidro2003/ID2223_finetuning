The correct answer is B) Blue Whale.

The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest mammal on Earth, with some individuals reaching lengths of up to 33 meters (108 feet) and weighing up to 180 metric tons (200 tons). They are also the largest animal to have ever existed on our planet.

Here's a comparison of the other options:

A) African Elephant: While they are the largest land animal, they typically reach lengths of up to 6 meters (20 feet) and weigh up to 6 tons.

C) Giraffe: The giraffe is the tallest mammal, but not the largest. They typically reach heights of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and weigh up to 400 kilograms (880 pounds).

D) Polar Bear: The polar bear is the largest land carnivore, but not the largest mammal. They typically reach lengths of up to 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh up to 350 kilograms (770 pounds).

It's worth noting that the blue whale is not only the largest mammal but also the largest animal to have ever existed on our planet.
