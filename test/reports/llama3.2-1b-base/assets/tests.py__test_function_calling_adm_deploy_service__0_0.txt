Here's a sample JSON response that deploys the API Gateway version 2.1.0 to the production environment:

```json
{
  "function": "deploy_service",
  "name": "api-gateway-2.1.0",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "environment": "prod"
}
```

This response includes the following details:

- `function`: The name of the deployment function.
- `name`: The name of the deployment.
- `version`: The version of the API Gateway.
- `environment`: The environment in which the API Gateway will be deployed. In this case, it's set to `prod`, which means the API Gateway will be deployed in the production environment.

To deploy the API Gateway to production, you would use the following command:

```bash
deploy_service --function api-gateway-2.1.0 --name api-gateway-2.1.0 --version 2.1.0 --environment prod
```

This command deploys the API Gateway version 2.1.0 to the production environment.
