Here's a step-by-step thought process:

1. **Physical properties**: The person carrying an umbrella on a sunny day might know that the umbrella is made of a lightweight material, such as nylon or polyester, which is designed to withstand the sun's rays.

2. **Wind resistance**: The person might also know that the wind can cause the umbrella to flap or blow the umbrella inside out, making it difficult to keep it closed.

3. **Sun protection**: The person might be aware that the sun's UV rays can cause the umbrella's fabric to become brittle and discolored, making it less effective at providing shade.

4. **Umbrella design**: The person might know that umbrellas are designed to be compact and lightweight, which is why they often have a collapsible or foldable design.

5. **Weather conditions**: The person might be familiar with the typical weather conditions on a sunny day, such as high temperatures, low humidity, and clear skies.

6. **Safety precautions**: The person might know that carrying an umbrella on a sunny day can be hazardous, especially for people with mobility issues or those who are not familiar with the wind.

7. **Practical considerations**: The person might be aware of the practical considerations of carrying an umbrella on a sunny day, such as the need to secure the umbrella to prevent it from blowing away or getting damaged.

Considering these factors, the person carrying an umbrella on a sunny day might know more about the practical and safety aspects of carrying an umbrella than I do.
