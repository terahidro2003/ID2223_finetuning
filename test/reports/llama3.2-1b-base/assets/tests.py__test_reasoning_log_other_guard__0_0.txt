To solve this problem, I would ask the following question:

"If I ask the first guard which door leads to freedom, what will he say?"

If the first guard says the door to freedom, then the second guard will also say the door to freedom, as both will be lying about their previous statement.

However, if the first guard says the door to death, then the second guard will tell the truth, saying the door to death.

In this case, the first guard will lie, and the second guard will tell the truth. 

So, the correct answer is: The first guard will say the door to death, and the second guard will say the door to freedom. 

Final Answer: The first guard will say the door to death, and the second guard will say the door to freedom.
