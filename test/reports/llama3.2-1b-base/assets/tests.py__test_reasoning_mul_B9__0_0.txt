To answer this question, we need to follow the steps of the OSI model.

Step 1: Identify the layer of the OSI model that is responsible for routing.
Step 2: Review the functions of each layer of the OSI model.

Step 3: Based on the functions of each layer, determine which layer is responsible for routing.

Step 4: Answer the question.

Step 5: Provide the final answer.

Step 6: Provide the response with a line break at the end.

Step 7: Review the response to ensure accuracy.

Step 8: If necessary, revise the response based on feedback.

Step 9: Confirm the final answer.

Step 10: End the process.

Step 1: The Transport layer is responsible for providing reliable data transfer services. It does not involve routing.

Step 2: The Network layer is responsible for routing. It examines the destination address and forwards the data to the correct destination.

Step 3: The Network layer is the layer of the OSI model responsible for routing.

Step 4: The Network layer is the layer of the OSI model responsible for routing.

Step 5: The final answer is: Network.

Final Answer: Network.
