To understand why the coffee shop has a long line at 8 AM on Monday but is nearly empty at 2 PM, let's break down the situation:

1. **Monday Morning Rush**: On Monday mornings, the coffee shop is likely to be busy due to the weekend's coffee consumption. People who have been working late the previous night or weekend might stop by the coffee shop to grab a quick coffee before heading home.

2. **Long Line at 8 AM**: The long line at 8 AM indicates that the coffee shop is busy, but not excessively so. This suggests that the coffee shop is catering to a large number of people who are likely to be early risers or those who have a long day ahead of them.

3. **2 PM Empty Line**: At 2 PM, the coffee shop is nearly empty. This could be due to several factors:
   - **Lunch Break**: Many people might be taking a lunch break, and the coffee shop might be closed to customers during this time.
   - **Afternoon Slump**: After a busy morning, people might be looking for a break or a place to relax before the rest of the day. The coffee shop might be closed to customers during this time.
   - **Afternoon Rush**: Although less likely, it's also possible that the coffee shop is experiencing an afternoon rush, where people are stopping by for a quick coffee before the rest of the day.

Considering these factors, it seems that the coffee shop is catering to a large number of early risers or those with a long day ahead of them, which is why it's busy at 8 AM but nearly empty at 2 PM.
