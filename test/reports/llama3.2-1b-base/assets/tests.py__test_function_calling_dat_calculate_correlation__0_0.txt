To calculate the Pearson correlation between temperature and sales, we'll need to make a few assumptions and use the following tools:

* Decompose series: We'll use the `decompose_series` function to decompose the time series into its components.
* Detect seasonality: We'll use the `detect_seasonality` function to detect any patterns in the data.
* Forecast values: We won't need to use this function as we're not forecasting any values.
* Calculate correlation: We'll use the `calculate_correlation` function to calculate the Pearson correlation.

Here's an example of how you can use these tools to calculate the Pearson correlation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import decompose_series
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import detect_seasonality
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import forecast_values

# Load the data
data = {
    'Temperature': [20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 20],
    'Sales': [100, 120, 90, 110, 130, 80, 100, 110, 90, 110, 130, 80, 100, 110, 90, 110]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Decompose the series
decompose = decompose_series(df['Temperature'], df['Sales'])

# Print the decomposed series
print(decompose)

# Detect seasonality
seasonal = detect_seasonality(df['Temperature'], df['Sales'])

# Print the detected seasonality
print(seasonal)

# Forecast values
forecast = forecast_values(df['Temperature'], df['Sales'], seasonal)

# Print the forecasted values
print(forecast)
```

This code will decompose the temperature and sales series, detect any seasonality, and forecast the values for the next period. The `forecast_values` function will return a DataFrame with the forecasted values.

Once you have the decomposed and forecasted series, you can calculate the Pearson correlation using the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Calculate the Pearson correlation
correlation = np.corrcoef(df['Temperature'], df['Sales'])

# Print the Pearson correlation
print(correlation)
```

This code will calculate the Pearson correlation between the temperature and sales series and print the result.
