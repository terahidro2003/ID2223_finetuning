To solve this, let's consider the properties of the word. 

Since the word reads the same upside down when typed in all capital letters, it must be a palindrome. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as it does forward. 

Considering the 5-letter word, we can start by listing all possible 5-letter palindromes: 

- A
- A
- A
- No other 5-letter palindromes exist in English.

However, we can try typing the word in all capital letters and see if it reads the same upside down: 

- A
- A
- A
- A

Since it doesn't read the same upside down, we can try another word. 

- A
- A
- A
- A

We can try typing the word in all capital letters and see if it reads the same upside down: 

- A
- A
- A
- A

The word "A" is a 5-letter palindrome. 

Final Answer: A
