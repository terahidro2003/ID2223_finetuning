To solve this problem, we need to find a sorting algorithm that has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and is often used in practice.

Bubble Sort (A) has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not O(n log n). Insertion Sort (D) has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is also not O(n log n).

Merge Sort (B) has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer.

Selection Sort (C) has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is not O(n log n). While it is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, it is still used in practice for certain scenarios.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) Merge Sort.

Final Answer: B) Merge Sort.
