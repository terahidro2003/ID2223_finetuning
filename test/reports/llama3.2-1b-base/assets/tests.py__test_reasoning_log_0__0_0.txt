To find the result, we need to multiply all the numbers on the telephone dial pad (1-9 and 0). 

First, let's multiply the numbers 1 and 9:
1 * 9 = 9

Next, let's multiply the numbers 1 and 0:
1 * 0 = 0

Now, let's multiply the numbers 9 and 0:
9 * 0 = 0

Finally, let's multiply the numbers 9 and 0:
9 * 0 = 0

The final result is: 0
