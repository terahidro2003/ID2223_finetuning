Here's an example of how you can trigger a build for your frontend app on the main branch with debug parameters:

```json
{
  "function": "trigger_build",
  "project": "frontend-app",
  "branch": "main",
  "parameters": {
    "debug": "true"
  }
}
```

In this example:

- `trigger_build` is the function that triggers the build.
- `project` is the name of your frontend app.
- `branch` is the branch where you want to trigger the build. In this case, it's the main branch.
- `parameters` is an object that contains the debug parameters. In this case, we're setting `debug` to `true`.

You can also use the `CI/CD pipeline manager` API to trigger a build. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://your-cicd-pipeline-manager.com/api",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": "{\"function\": \"trigger_build\", \"project\": \"frontend-app\", \"branch\": \"main\", \"parameters\": {\"debug\": \"true\"}}"
}
```

In this example:

- `method` is the HTTP method to use (in this case, `POST`).
- `url` is the URL of the API endpoint.
- `headers` is an object that contains the headers for the request.
- `body` is the JSON body of the request.

Make sure to replace `https://your-cicd-pipeline-manager.com` with the actual URL of your CI/CD pipeline manager.
