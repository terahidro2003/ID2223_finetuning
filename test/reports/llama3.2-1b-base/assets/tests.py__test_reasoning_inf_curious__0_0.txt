The child is likely in the stage of 'Exploratory Curiosity' or 'Curiosity-Driven Inquiry'. At this stage, children are naturally curious about the world around them and often ask questions to clarify their thoughts or seek more information.

In this stage, children are still developing their language skills and may not have the ability to articulate their thoughts or questions clearly. They may ask questions like 'Why?' to seek more information or to understand the context of a situation.

It's also possible that the child is in the stage of 'Imagination and Creativity', where they are beginning to think about abstract concepts and may ask questions that are more open-ended or philosophical in nature.

However, it's worth noting that the child's curiosity and questioning style may also be influenced by their age and developmental stage. For example, younger children may be more likely to ask questions like 'Why?' in a more literal sense, while older children may be more likely to ask questions that are more abstract or philosophical in nature.

In any case, the child's curiosity and questioning style are an important part of their development, and it's essential to provide them with opportunities to ask questions and explore their thoughts in a safe and supportive environment.

Final Answer: The child is likely in the stage of 'Exploratory Curiosity' or 'Curiosity-Driven Inquiry'.
