A child asking 'why' after every statement is typically in the preoperational stage of cognitive development, which is the stage before formal logic and the beginning of formal logic.

In the preoperational stage, children are still learning to think logically and make sense of the world around them. They are beginning to understand the concept of causality and the idea that events can be caused by other events. However, they are not yet able to think abstractly or make logical connections between ideas.

When a child asks 'why' after every statement, it's like they're trying to understand the underlying reason or explanation for something. They're not yet able to think about the bigger picture or the abstract concepts that we take for granted.

This stage is often referred to as the 'pre-logical' stage, as children are still learning to think logically and are not yet able to think abstractly. It's a critical stage in cognitive development, as it lays the foundation for more advanced thinking and problem-solving.

In this stage, children are also beginning to develop their sense of self and their ability to think about themselves and their place in the world. They're learning to think about their own thoughts and feelings, and to understand the world around them in a more nuanced and complex way.

So, in short, a child asking 'why' after every statement is typically in the preoperational stage of cognitive development, where they're still learning to think logically and making sense of the world around them.
