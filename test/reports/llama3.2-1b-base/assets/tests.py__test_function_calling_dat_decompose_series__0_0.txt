Here's an example of how to decompose the `monthly_sales` series using an additive model in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import plot_acf
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import plot_pacf

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('monthly_sales.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=['date'])

# Plot the original series
fig, ax = plot_acf(data['monthly_sales'], lags=20, conf.level=0.95)
ax.set_title('Original Series')
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Value')
fig.show()

# Perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
result = adfuller(data['monthly_sales'], method='adf')
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('ADF P-Value:', result[1])
print('ADF Conclusion:')
if result[1] < 0.05:
    print('Reject the null hypothesis. The series is stationary.')
else:
    print('Fail to reject the null hypothesis. The series is non-stationary.')

# Decompose the series using the additive model
decomposition = adfuller(data['monthly_sales'], method='additive')
print('Additive Decomposition:')
print('Function:', decomposition[0])
print('Series:', decomposition[1])
print('Model:', decomposition[2])
print('Coefficients:')
for i, coeff in enumerate(decomposition[2].items()):
    print(f'Coefficient {i+1}: {coeff}')

# Plot the decomposed series
fig, ax = plot_acf(decomposition[1], lags=20, conf.level=0.95)
ax.set_title('Decomposed Series')
ax.set_xlabel('Date')
ax.set_ylabel('Value')
fig.show()
```

This code performs the following steps:

1. Loads the `monthly_sales` series from a CSV file.
2. Plots the original series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.
3. Decomposes the series using the additive model.
4. Prints the function, series, and model used for decomposition.
5. Plots the decomposed series using the ACF and PACF plots to visualize the decomposition.

Note: This code assumes that the `monthly_sales` series is a time series with a stationary pattern. If the pattern is non-stationary, you may need to use a different decomposition method, such as the Exponential Smoothing (ES) method.
