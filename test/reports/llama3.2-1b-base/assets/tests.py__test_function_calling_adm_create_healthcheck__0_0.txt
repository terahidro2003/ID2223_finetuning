Here's a JSON response specifying the function to call, its parameters, and values:

```json
{
  "function": "create_healthcheck",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "interval_seconds": 60,
  "timeout": 5
}
```

This healthcheck will be created every 60 seconds and will have a 5-second timeout.
