Here's a sample JSON request to create a health check for the specified endpoint:

```json
{
  "function": "create_healthcheck",
  "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "interval_seconds": 60,
  "timeout": 5
}
```

This will create a health check that:

- Checks the specified endpoint every 60 seconds.
- Has a 5-second timeout.

Please note that this is a basic example and might not work in all environments. For example, it might not work in a production environment where the health check endpoint might be blocked by a firewall or load balancer. 

Also, ensure that the `create_healthcheck` function is properly configured and that the endpoint is accessible and not blocked by any security measures. 

If you want to use the `set_metric_threshold` function to set a threshold for the health check, you can do so like this:

```json
{
  "function": "set_metric_threshold",
  "metric": "https://api.example.com/health",
  "operator": "Threshold",
  "value": 1
}
```

This will set a threshold of 1 for the specified endpoint. You can adjust the threshold value as needed.
