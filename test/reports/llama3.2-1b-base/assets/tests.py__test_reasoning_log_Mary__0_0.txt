To find the fifth daughter's name, we need to know the first name of Mary's father. However, the problem statement does not provide this information. 

Assuming Mary's father is a man, we can try to figure it out. Since there are 5 daughters, Mary must be a girl. 

If Mary is a girl, then Mary's father must be a man. In that case, Mary's father would have 4 daughters: Nana, Nene, Nini, and Nono. 

Since Mary's father has 5 daughters, it is likely that Mary is one of the daughters. Therefore, the fifth daughter's name is Nono.
