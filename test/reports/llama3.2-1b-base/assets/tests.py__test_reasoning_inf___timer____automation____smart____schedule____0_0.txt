To determine the system being used, let's analyze the situation:

1. The lights turn on and off at different times each evening.
2. The neighbor is on vacation.

Considering these points, it's likely that the neighbor is using a smart home system or a home automation system. Here's a possible explanation:

- The neighbor likely has a smart home system, such as a smart thermostat or a smart lighting system, which allows them to control the lights remotely using a smartphone app or voice assistant.
- Since the neighbor is on vacation, they may not be physically present to control the lights.
- The lights turning on and off at different times could be due to the smart home system's scheduling or automation features, which allow the system to adjust the lighting schedule based on the time of day or the day of the week.

However, without more information or a specific system in mind, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact system being used.
