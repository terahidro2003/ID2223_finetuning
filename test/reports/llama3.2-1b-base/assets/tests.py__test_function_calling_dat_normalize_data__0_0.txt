```json
{
  "function": "normalize_data",
  "columns": ["salary", "experience"],
  "method": "min-max"
}
```

This function will normalize the 'salary' and 'experience' columns using the min-max method. The min-max method scales the data to a common range, typically between 0 and 1, which is ideal for many machine learning algorithms.
