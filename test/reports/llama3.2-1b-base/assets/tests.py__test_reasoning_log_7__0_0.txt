To find out how many more books can fit, we need to first find out how many books are already on the shelves. 

Number of books already on the shelves = 28
Number of books per shelf = 7
Number of shelves = 5

Total books already on the shelves = Number of books already on the shelves * Number of shelves
= 28 * 5
= 140

Now, we need to find out how many books can fit in total. 
Total books that can fit = Total books already on the shelves + Number of books that can fit
= 140 + 28
= 168

Now, we need to find out how many more books can fit. 
Number of books that can fit = Total books that can fit - Number of books already on the shelves
= 168 - 140
= 28

So, 28 more books can fit on the bookshelf.
