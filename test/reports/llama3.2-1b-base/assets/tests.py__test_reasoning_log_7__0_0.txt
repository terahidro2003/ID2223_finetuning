To find out how many more books can fit, we need to first find out how many books are already on the shelves. We know that each shelf can hold 7 books, and there are 5 shelves. So, the total number of books already on the shelves is 7 * 5 = 35.

Now, we need to find out how many books can fit in total. We know that there are 28 books already on the shelves, and we want to know how many more books can fit. So, the total number of books that can fit is 35 + 28 = 63.

To find out how many more books can fit, we need to subtract the number of books already on the shelves from the total number of books that can fit. So, 63 - 28 = 35.

Therefore, 35 more books can fit on the bookshelf.
