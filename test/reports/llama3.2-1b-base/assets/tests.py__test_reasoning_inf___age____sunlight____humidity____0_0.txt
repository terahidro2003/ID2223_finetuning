To determine the cause of the yellowed and brittle pages of the book, let's consider the factors that could contribute to such a condition.

1. **Moisture**: High humidity can cause the pages to become brittle and yellowed. This is because moisture can cause the paper to swell, leading to cracks and yellowing.

2. **Light exposure**: Direct sunlight can cause the pages to fade and become brittle. This is because light can cause the dyes in the paper to break down, leading to discoloration.

3. **Temperature**: Extreme temperatures can also cause the pages to become brittle and yellowed. This is because temperature fluctuations can cause the paper to expand and contract, leading to cracks and yellowing.

4. **Chemical reactions**: Chemical reactions, such as those caused by mold or mildew, can also cause the pages to become brittle and yellowed.

5. **Physical damage**: Physical damage, such as crushing or bending, can also cause the pages to become brittle and yellowed.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the yellowed and brittle pages of the book are caused by a combination of moisture, light exposure, and temperature fluctuations. However, without more information or a specific description of the book, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

To further investigate, you may want to consider the following:

- Has the book been stored in a dry, cool place?
- Has the book been exposed to direct sunlight?
- Has the book been stored in a humid or warm environment?
- Has the book been damaged or crushed in any way?
