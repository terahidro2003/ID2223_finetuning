To solve this problem, let's break down the steps involved in the alphabet song:

1. **Identifying the sequence**: The child needs to recognize the sequence of letters in the alphabet song.
2. **Recognizing individual letters**: The child should be able to identify each individual letter in the sequence.
3. **Understanding the song's purpose**: The child should understand that the alphabet song is a tool for learning and remembering the sequence of letters.

Given these steps, the child is missing the **skill of phonological awareness**. Phonological awareness is the ability to recognize and manipulate sounds in words. In this case, the child needs to recognize the sequence of letters in the alphabet song, which requires phonological awareness.

Without phonological awareness, the child may struggle to recognize individual letters, even if they can sing the alphabet song.
