A child who knows the alphabet song but can't identify individual letters is missing the skill of phonemic awareness. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate the individual sounds (phonemes) in words.

In the case of the alphabet song, the child is likely missing the ability to identify and manipulate individual sounds, such as /a/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. This skill is essential for reading and writing, as it allows children to recognize and blend sounds together to form words.

Phonemic awareness is a critical component of phonemic literacy, which is the ability to read and write with accuracy and fluency. Children who have developed phonemic awareness skills are better equipped to recognize and blend sounds together, which is essential for reading and writing.

If you're concerned about your child's phonemic awareness skills, you can try the following activities:

* Read the alphabet song together, and ask your child to identify the individual sounds.
* Use flashcards or pictures to help your child recognize individual sounds.
* Play games that involve identifying sounds, such as "What sound does the word 'cat' make?"
* Read simple stories together, and ask your child to identify the individual sounds in each word.

By working on phonemic awareness, your child can develop the skills they need to become a confident reader and writer.
