Here's the configuration for the firewall to block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 with a priority of 10:

```json
{
  "function": "configure_firewall",
  "rule": "block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 with priority 10",
  "action": "block",
  "priority": 10
}
```

This configuration will block all traffic from the 192.168.1.0/24 network with a priority of 10. 

Please note that you need to replace the IP address with your actual network's IP address. Also, ensure that the firewall is configured to allow traffic from the specified IP address in the first place. 

If you are using a firewall management system like Cisco's ASA or Juniper's Junos, the configuration might look different. Here's an example for Cisco's ASA:

```cisco
configure terminal
! Configure the firewall to block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 with a priority of 10
rule 10 in out allow 192.168.1.0/24 from any to any
```

And here's an example for Juniper's Junos:

```junos
configure
! Configure the firewall to block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 with a priority of 10
set firewall rule 10 in out allow 192.168.1.0/24 from any to any
```

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to configure the firewall.
