To find the binary representation of decimal 10, we need to convert it to binary first.

1. Divide 10 by 2: 10 ÷ 2 = 5 with remainder 0
2. Divide 5 by 2: 5 ÷ 2 = 2 with remainder 1
3. Divide 2 by 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1 with remainder 0
4. Divide 1 by 2: 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with remainder 1

Now, we can write the binary representation as the sequence of remainders in reverse order:

10 = 1 (1) 0 (0) 1 (1) 1 (1) 0 (0)

So, the binary representation of decimal 10 is 1010100.

Final Answer: 1010100
