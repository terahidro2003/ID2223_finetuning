To find the binary representation of decimal 10, we need to convert 10 to binary.

First, let's find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 10:

2^3 = 8
2^2 = 4
2^1 = 2
2^0 = 1

The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is 2^3 = 8.

Now, subtract 8 from 10:

10 - 8 = 2

So, we have 2 left to find the remainder.

2 / 2 = 1

Now, we have 1 left to find the remainder.

1 / 2 = 0

Now, we have found the binary representation of 10:

10 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
10 = 1110 in binary

The correct answer is D) 1111.
