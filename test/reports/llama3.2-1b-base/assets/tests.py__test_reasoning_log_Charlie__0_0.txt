To find the shortest person, we need to determine who is the shortest among Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

Since Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, we can conclude that Alice is taller than Charlie.

So, the order from shortest to tallest is: Alice, Bob, Charlie.

Therefore, Charlie is the shortest.
