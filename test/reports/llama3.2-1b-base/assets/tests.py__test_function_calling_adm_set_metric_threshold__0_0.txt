Here is the code to set the threshold for the `cpu_usage` metric to greater than 80:

```json
{
  "function": "set_metric_threshold",
  "metric": "cpu_usage",
  "operator": "gt",
  "value": 80
}
```

This will set the threshold for the `cpu_usage` metric to greater than 80. If the `cpu_usage` metric is less than or equal to 80, the threshold will be set to 80. 

Please note that this is a simple threshold setting. If you want to set a more complex threshold, you can use the following code:

```json
{
  "function": "set_metric_threshold",
  "metric": "cpu_usage",
  "operator": "gt",
  "value": 80,
  "config": {
    "period": "1m",  // 1 minute
    "start_time": "1d",  // 1 day
    "end_time": "1d",  // 1 day
    "start_time_unit": "h",  // start time in hours
    "end_time_unit": "h"  // end time in hours
  }
}
```

This will set the threshold to greater than 80 for the `cpu_usage` metric, and will also set the period to 1 minute, start time to 1 day, end time to 1 day, start time unit to hours, and end time unit to hours.
