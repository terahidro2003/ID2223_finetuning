To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. Two fathers: This means that the two fathers are the same person. Since they are the same person, they can be considered as one father.

2. Two sons: This means that there are two sons who are the same person.

3. Only 3 fish are caught total: Since there are two fathers and two sons, the total number of fish caught is 2 (fathers) + 2 (sons) = 4.

4. The answer involves a generational relationship: The puzzle states that the two fathers and two sons are the same person. This implies that the person who is the father of both sons is also the father of both fathers. However, this is not possible in reality, as a person cannot be both the father of two sons and the father of two fathers.

5. The correct answer is that the two fathers and two sons are actually the same person, who is a man. The puzzle is asking how this is possible, not what the person is. The answer is that the person is a man, and the puzzle is not asking about the person's identity or nature, but rather about the generational relationship between the two fathers and two sons.

Final Answer: The puzzle is asking about the generational relationship between two fathers and two sons, not about the person's identity or nature.
