This classic riddle is a great example of a lateral thinking puzzle. The answer is not about the number of fish caught, but rather about the generational relationship between the two fathers.

The two fathers are the same person, but they are different generations. The younger father is the one who caught the fish, while the older father is the one who is now the father of the younger father.

So, the answer is: "Two fathers and two sons go fishing. They each catch one fish. Only 3 fish are caught total."
