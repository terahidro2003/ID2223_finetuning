To find the number of days it takes for the snail to reach the top of the well, we need to calculate the net progress each day.

Each day, the snail climbs 3 feet up and slides back 2 feet at night. So, the net progress is 3 - 2 = 1 foot per day.

Since the well is 30 feet deep, the snail will reach the top after 30 days.

So, the answer is 30 days.
