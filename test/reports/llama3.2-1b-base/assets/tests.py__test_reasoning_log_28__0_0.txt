To solve this problem, we need to find the net progress the snail makes each day. 

Day 1: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 2: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 3: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 4: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 5: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 6: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 7: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 8: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 9: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 10: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 11: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 12: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 13: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 14: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 15: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 16: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 17: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 18: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 19: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 20: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 21: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 22: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 23: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 24: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 25: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 26: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 27: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 28: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 29: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches 1 foot. 

Day 30: The snail climbs 3 feet and slides back 2 feet, so it reaches the top of the well.

Therefore, it will take 30 days for the snail to reach the top of the well.
