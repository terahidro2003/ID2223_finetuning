To determine the likely reason for the lights being on and nobody being there, let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Security cameras**: It's possible that the office has security cameras installed to monitor the premises. However, since it's 10 PM on a Sunday, it's unlikely that the cameras are still active and recording footage.

2. **Maintenance or repairs**: The office might be undergoing maintenance or repairs, but it's unlikely that the lights are still on at this late hour.

3. **Power outage**: It's possible that there was a power outage in the office, but since it's 10 PM on a Sunday, it's unlikely that the power company would have left the lights on.

4. **Maintenance or cleaning**: The office might be undergoing a routine cleaning or maintenance process, but it's unlikely that the lights are still on at this late hour.

5. **Unusual or unexplained reason**: Given the unusual timing (10 PM on a Sunday), it's possible that there's an unexplained reason for the lights being on. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a hidden room, a secret meeting, or an unusual occurrence.

Considering these possibilities, the most likely reason for the lights being on and nobody being there is:
