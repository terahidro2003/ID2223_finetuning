At 10 PM on a Sunday, it's unlikely that all the lights in the office are on. Here are a few possible reasons:

1. **Maintenance or shutdown**: The office might be closed for maintenance or a scheduled shutdown, and the lights are still on to indicate that the building is secure.
2. **Security cameras**: The office might have security cameras installed to monitor the premises. The lights could be on to show that the cameras are still active.
3. **Power outage**: It's possible that there was a power outage in the building, and the lights are still on to indicate that the power is still available.
4. **Emergency lighting**: The lights might be on for emergency purposes, such as in case of a fire or other emergency.
5. **Unoccupied building**: The office might be unoccupied, but the lights are still on to indicate that the building is secure and not abandoned.

It's worth noting that it's unusual for offices to be left unattended on a Sunday evening, especially at 10 PM. If you're concerned about the situation, you could try contacting the building management or security team to inquire about the status of the office.
