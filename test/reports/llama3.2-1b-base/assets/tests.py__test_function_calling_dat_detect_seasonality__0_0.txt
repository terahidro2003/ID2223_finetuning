To detect seasonality in the revenue data with a 12-month period, we can use the `detect_seasonality` function from the `stats` library in Python. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.robust as smr

# Load the revenue data
revenue_data = pd.read_csv('revenue_data.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])

# Convert the date column to datetime
revenue_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(revenue_data['Date'])

# Set the frequency to monthly
revenue_data['Date'] = revenue_data['Date'].dt.month

# Detect seasonality
seasonality = smr.ols('Revenue ~ C', data=revenue_data).fit()

# Print the results
print(seasonality.summary())

# Plot the time series
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(revenue_data['Revenue'], label='Revenue')
plt.plot(seasonality.fittedvalues['C'], label='Seasonality')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

In this code:

1. We load the revenue data from a CSV file.
2. We convert the date column to datetime format.
3. We set the frequency to monthly.
4. We detect seasonality using the `ols` function from the `statsmodels` library.
5. We print the summary of the model.
6. We plot the time series using matplotlib.

The output will show the seasonality component of the revenue data, which is represented by the `C` column. The `C` column is a seasonal component that represents the monthly seasonality in the revenue data.

The plot will show the revenue data and the seasonal component, which will help us identify the seasonality pattern in the data.
