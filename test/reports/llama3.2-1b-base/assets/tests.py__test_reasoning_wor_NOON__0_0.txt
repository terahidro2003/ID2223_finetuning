To solve this, let's consider the constraints:

1. The word must be 4 letters long.
2. It must be able to be written forward, backward, or upside down and still be read the same.

After some thought, I think I have a possible solution:

The word is "swap".

Forward: S-W-A-P
Backward: P-A-W-S
Upside Down: S-P-A-W

This word meets all the criteria, and it's a common English word that fits the description.
