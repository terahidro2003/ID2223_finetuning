Here's an example of how you can create a users table with the specified columns, partitioned by region, and optimized for storage:

```json
{
  "function": "create_table",
  "name": "users",
  "schema": {
    "id": {
      "type": "integer",
      "primary_key": true
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "nullable": true
    },
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "nullable": true
    },
    "region": {
      "type": "string",
      "nullable": true
    }
  },
  "partition_key": "region"
}
```

In this example, we've created a users table with the following columns:

- `id`: an integer primary key
- `name`: a string column that can be null
- `email`: a string column that can be null
- `region`: a string column that can be null

We've also specified that the `region` column is partitioned by region, which means that the data will be stored in separate tables based on the region.

To optimize the storage, we've used the following optimization strategy:

- We've created separate tables for each region, which means that we'll have separate indexes for each region.
- We've used the `id` column as the primary key for each region, which means that we'll have a unique identifier for each user in each region.
- We've used the `region` column to partition the data, which means that we'll have separate tables for each region.

Here's an example of how the data might be stored in each region:

```json
{
  "region": "North",
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "region": "North"
}

{
  "region": "South",
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
  "region": "South"
}

{
  "region": "East",
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Bob Johnson",
  "email": "bob.johnson@example.com",
  "region": "East"
}
```

This is just one example of how the data might be stored in each region. The actual storage will depend on the specific requirements of your application.
