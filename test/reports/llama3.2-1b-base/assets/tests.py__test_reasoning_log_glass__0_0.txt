To find the answer, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that a red house is made of red bricks.
2. We also know that a blue house is made of blue bricks.
3. Since the color of the house is the same as the material used to build it, we can conclude that the greenhouse is also made of blue bricks.

Therefore, the answer is: A greenhouse is made of blue bricks.
