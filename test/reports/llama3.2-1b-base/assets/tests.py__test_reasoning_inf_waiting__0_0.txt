To determine what the person is likely doing, let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Checking the time**: They might be checking the time to ensure they don't miss their appointment or meeting.
2. **Counting time**: They could be counting the time until their next appointment or meeting.
3. **Waiting for someone**: They might be waiting for someone else to arrive or for a specific event to start.
4. **Checking the weather**: They could be checking the weather outside the cafe to plan their next outing.
5. **Waiting for a bus or train**: They might be waiting for a bus or train to arrive, as they are sitting in the cafe and not at home.

Considering these possibilities, it's likely that the person is checking the time repeatedly while sitting in the cafe.
