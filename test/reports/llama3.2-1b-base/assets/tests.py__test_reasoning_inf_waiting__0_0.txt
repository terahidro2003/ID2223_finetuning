Someone checking their watch repeatedly while sitting in a cafe is likely doing this to:

1. Check the time to ensure they're not running late for an appointment or meeting.
2. Ensure they're not missing any important events or appointments.
3. Make sure they're on schedule for a meeting or appointment.
4. Avoid being late, which could impact their professional or social life.
5. Possibly, they're checking their phone or responding to messages.

It's also possible that they're checking their watch to:

- Check the time to see if it's time for a coffee break or a snack.
- Make sure they're not running out of time for a social engagement.
- Ensure they're not missing any important announcements or updates.

However, it's worth noting that checking a watch repeatedly in a cafe can also be seen as impolite or inconsiderate, as it may be disrupting the other patrons and the cafe's atmosphere.
