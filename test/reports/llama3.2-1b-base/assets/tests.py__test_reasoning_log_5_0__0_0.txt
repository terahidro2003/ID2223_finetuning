Let's say the ball costs 'x' cents. Since the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the bat costs 'x + 1' cents.

The total cost of the bat and the ball together is $1.10. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 1) = 1.10

Combine like terms:

2x + 1 = 1.10

Subtract 1 from both sides:

2x = 0.10

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 0.05

The ball costs 5 cents.
