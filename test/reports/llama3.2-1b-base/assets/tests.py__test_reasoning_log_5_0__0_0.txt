To find the cost of the ball, let's denote the cost of the ball as 'x'. Since the bat costs $1 more than the ball, the cost of the bat is 'x + $1'.

The total cost of the bat and the ball together is $1.10. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $1) = $1.10

Combine like terms:

2x + $1 = $1.10

Subtract $1 from both sides:

2x = $0.10

Divide both sides by 2:

x = $0.05

Since the ball costs $0.05, the final answer is:

Final Answer: $0.05
