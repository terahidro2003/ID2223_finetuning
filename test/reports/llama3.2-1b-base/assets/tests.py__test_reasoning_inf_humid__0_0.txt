Given that the bread was bought only 2 days ago, it's likely that the mold was introduced into the bread during the packaging or storage process. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Cross-contamination**: When the bread was stored in a crowded or dirty environment, it was exposed to other foods or substances that had mold on them. This could have been due to a previous moldy product, a dirty storage container, or a contaminated environment.
2. **Moisture**: If the bread was stored in a humid environment, it was more likely to develop mold. This could have been due to a leaky container, a damp storage area, or a poorly ventilated space.
3. **Temperature**: If the bread was stored at a high temperature (above 50°F/10°C), it was more likely to develop mold. This could have been due to a warm storage area or a storage container that was not properly sealed.
4. **Packaging**: If the bread was stored in a package that was not properly sealed or protected from moisture, it was more likely to develop mold. This could have been due to a poorly sealed container or a package that was not stored in a dry environment.
5. **Handling**: If the bread was handled roughly or was not stored properly, it was more likely to develop mold. This could have been due to a rough handling of the bread, a careless storage of the bread, or a storage container that was not properly cleaned and sanitized.

To prevent mold growth in the future, it's essential to store bread properly, including:

* Storing bread in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated environment
* Keeping bread away from other foods that may have mold on them
* Storing bread in a sealed container or bag to prevent moisture from entering
* Handling bread gently and carefully to prevent damage
* Regularly checking bread for signs of mold or spoilage
