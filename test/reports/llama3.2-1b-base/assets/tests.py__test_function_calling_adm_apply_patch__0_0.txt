I can provide you with a sample command to apply the security patch. Please note that you should have the necessary permissions and access to the database server to apply the patch.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
sudo apt install -y git
sudo apt install -y curl
sudo apt install -y unzip
sudo apt install -y wget
sudo apt install -y unzip
sudo apt install -y apt-get
sudo apt install -y apt

# Download the security patch
curl -s -f https://example.com/cve-2024-1234.patch -o /tmp/cve-2024-1234.patch

# Apply the security patch
apt-get update
apt-get install -y patch
patch -i -s /tmp/cve-2024-1234.patch
```

Please replace `https://example.com/cve-2024-1234.patch` with the actual URL of the security patch.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to apply the patch:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y patch
patch -i -s /tmp/cve-2024-1234.patch
```

After applying the patch, you can verify that the patch was applied successfully by running the following command:

```bash
apt-get show -y | grep Patch
```

This command will show you the patch ID and other information about the patch.
