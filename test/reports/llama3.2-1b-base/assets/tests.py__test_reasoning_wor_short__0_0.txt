To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information. We have a 5-letter word that becomes shorter when we add two letters to it.

Step 1: We know that the word has 5 letters. 

Step 2: We also know that adding two letters to the word makes it shorter.

Step 3: We can start by listing all possible 5-letter words: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Step 4: Now, let's try adding two letters to each of these 5-letter words to see if any of them become shorter.

Step 5: After trying different combinations, we find that the word "Hale" becomes shorter when we add the letters "El" to it.

Step 6: Therefore, the 5-letter word that becomes shorter when we add two letters to it is "Hale".

Final Answer: Hale
