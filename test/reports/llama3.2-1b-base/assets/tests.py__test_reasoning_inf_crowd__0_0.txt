Authorities are anticipating a significant increase in trash and litter in the park after the extra trash bins are installed. This is likely to be a major issue for several reasons:

1. **Increased waste generation**: With more bins available, people are more likely to throw away their trash and litter, leading to a surge in waste generation.
2. **Litter accumulation**: The extra bins will likely lead to a buildup of litter, including plastic, paper, and other materials, which can harm the environment and wildlife.
3. **Potential health concerns**: A large amount of trash and litter can pose health risks, including the spread of diseases and the contamination of water sources.
4. **Maintenance and cleanup challenges**: The increased volume of trash and litter will require more maintenance and cleanup efforts, which can be time-consuming and costly.

To mitigate these issues, authorities may consider implementing measures such as:

* Regular trash collection and recycling programs
* Education and outreach campaigns to encourage responsible waste management
* Increased enforcement of littering and waste disposal regulations
* Implementing waste management infrastructure, such as recycling facilities and composting programs
* Collaborating with local businesses and residents to promote sustainable waste practices

Overall, authorities are anticipating a significant increase in trash and litter, and are working to address this issue through various measures.
