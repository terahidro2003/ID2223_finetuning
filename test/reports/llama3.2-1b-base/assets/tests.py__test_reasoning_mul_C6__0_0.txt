To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options:

A) 1943 - This is too early. World War II started in 1939, so it would have ended in 1943.

B) 1944 - This is also too early. World War II ended in 1945.

C) 1945 - This is the correct answer. World War II officially ended on September 2, 1945, when Japan formally surrendered to the Allied Powers, marking the end of the war in the Pacific.

D) 1946 - This is too late. The war in Europe ended in 1945, and the war in the Pacific ended in 1945 as well.

Final Answer: 1945
