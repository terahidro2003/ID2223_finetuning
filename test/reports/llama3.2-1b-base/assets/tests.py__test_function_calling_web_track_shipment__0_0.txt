I will use the following function to track the shipment:

```json
{
  "function": "track_shipment",
  "tracking_number": "1Z999AA10123456784",
  "carrier": "UPS"
}
```

Please note that I'm assuming you are using a JSON format for the request. If you are using a different format, please adjust accordingly.

If you want to send this request via a specific API or endpoint, here is an example of how you can do it:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/track_shipment",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "data": {
    "tracking_number": "1Z999AA10123456784",
    "carrier": "UPS"
  }
}
```

Replace the `https://api.example.com/track_shipment` URL with the actual URL of the API endpoint that you are using.

Please make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual values.
