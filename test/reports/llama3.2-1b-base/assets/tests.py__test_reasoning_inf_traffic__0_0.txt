Based on the information provided, it seems that the website is experiencing slow loading times only during business hours. This suggests that the bottleneck is likely related to the business hours.

Here are a few possible bottlenecks that could be causing the slow loading times:

1. **Peak traffic hours**: The website is experiencing high traffic during business hours, which is causing the slow loading times.
2. **Server load**: The website is running on a single server, which is experiencing high load during peak hours, causing the slow loading times.
3. **Database queries**: The website is making many database queries during peak hours, which is causing the slow loading times.
4. **Image or file serving**: The website is serving images or files from a remote server during peak hours, which is causing the slow loading times.

To identify the specific bottleneck, you could try the following:

* Monitor server logs to see if there are any errors or issues related to peak traffic hours.
* Use tools like Google Analytics or WebPageTest to analyze the website's performance and identify any bottlenecks.
* Test the website during off-peak hours to see if the slow loading times persist.
* Consider implementing caching or other optimization techniques to improve the website's performance.

By identifying the bottleneck, you can take steps to improve the website's performance and reduce the slow loading times.
