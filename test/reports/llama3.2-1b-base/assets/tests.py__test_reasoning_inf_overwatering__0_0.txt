There are several reasons why a plant's leaves might be turning yellow despite regular watering. Here are some potential causes:

1. **Overwatering**: Too much water can cause roots to rot, leading to yellowing leaves. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it's wet, wait a few days before watering again.
2. **Underwatering**: On the other hand, if the plant is not getting enough water, the leaves might turn yellow. Make sure to water your plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch.
3. **Nutrient deficiency**: Lack of essential nutrients like nitrogen, iron, or magnesium can cause yellowing leaves. Fertilize your plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer (20-20-20) to ensure it's getting the necessary nutrients.
4. **Too much direct sunlight**: If your plant is not used to direct sunlight, it might be causing the leaves to turn yellow. Consider moving it to a spot with filtered sunlight or providing shade during peak sun hours.
5. **Temperature fluctuations**: Sudden changes in temperature can shock the plant, causing leaves to turn yellow. Keep your plant away from drafts, air conditioning vents, or heating radiators.
6. **Pests or diseases**: Infestations or infections can cause yellowing leaves. Inspect your plant carefully and treat any pests or diseases promptly.
7. **Root bound**: If the plant has outgrown its container, it might be root-bound. Consider repotting your plant in a larger container with fresh, well-draining soil.
8. **Aging leaves**: As leaves age, they naturally turn yellow and fall off. This is a natural process, but it can be accelerated by factors like overwatering, underwatering, or poor air circulation.
9. **Environmental stress**: Exposure to extreme temperatures, humidity, or air pollution can cause stress, leading to yellowing leaves.
10. **Root rot**: If the roots are rotting, it can cause the entire plant to turn yellow. Check the roots by gently removing the plant from its pot and inspecting the roots.

To address the issue, you can try the following:

* Adjust your watering schedule to ensure the plant is not over- or under-watered.
* Inspect your plant for pests, diseases, or nutrient deficiencies.
* Provide optimal growing conditions, including sufficient light, temperature, and humidity.
* Fertilize your plant to ensure it's getting the necessary nutrients.
* Prune or repot your plant to refresh its roots and promote healthy growth.

If the issue persists, consider consulting with a local nursery or gardening expert for personalized advice.
