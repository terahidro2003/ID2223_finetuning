To find the number of rungs above water, we need to calculate the total number of rungs and then subtract the number of rungs that are submerged.

Since the tide rises 5 feet, we can assume that the ship is 5 feet above the waterline. 

The ship is 10 rungs above water at low tide. This means that the ship is 10 rungs + 5 rungs = 15 rungs above the waterline.

Now, we need to find the number of rungs that are submerged. Since the rungs are 1 foot apart, we can divide the total number of rungs by 2 to find the number of rungs that are submerged.

15 rungs / 2 = 7.5 rungs

Since we can't have a fraction of a rung, we round down to 7 rungs. 

Now, we can find the number of rungs above water by subtracting the number of submerged rungs from the total number of rungs.

15 rungs - 7 rungs = 8 rungs

So, there are 8 rungs above water.
