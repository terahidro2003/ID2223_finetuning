To find the number of rungs above water, we need to subtract the number of rungs below water from the total number of rungs.

At low tide, 10 rungs are above water.
The tide rises 5 feet, which is equivalent to 5 * 12 = 60 rungs.

So, the total number of rungs is 10 + 60 = 70.

Now, we subtract the number of rungs below water from the total:
70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 rungs above water.
