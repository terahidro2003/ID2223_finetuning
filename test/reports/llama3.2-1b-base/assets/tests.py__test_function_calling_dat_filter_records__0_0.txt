To filter the orders table where the status equals "completed", you can use the following command:

```sql
filter_records orders table where status = "completed"
```

This will return all orders where the status is "completed". 

If you are using a different database system, the command may vary. Here's an example in MySQL:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders 
WHERE status = "completed";
```

This will return all orders where the status is "completed".

If you are using a different analytics platform, the command may vary. Here's an example in Power BI:

```dax
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE status = "completed";
```

This will return all orders where the status is "completed".

If you are using a different tool, the command may vary. Here's an example in Tableau:

```python
from tableau import Tableau
t = Tableau()
t.connect()
t.select("orders")
t.filter(t.select("orders") == "completed")
t.show()
```

This will return all orders where the status is "completed".
