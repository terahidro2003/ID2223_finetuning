To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many widgets one machine can make in one minute.

Since 5 machines can make 5 widgets in 5 minutes, one machine can make 1 widget in 5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many widgets 100 machines can make in one minute:

100 machines x 1 widget per machine = 100 widgets per minute

Since 100 machines can make 100 widgets in one minute, we can multiply the number of widgets per minute by the number of minutes to find the total number of minutes:

100 widgets per minute x 60 minutes = 6000 widgets

Now, let's divide the total number of widgets by the number of widgets one machine can make in one minute:

6000 widgets / 1 widget per minute = 6000 minutes

Therefore, it would take 100 machines 6000 minutes to make 100 widgets.
