To find the time it takes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets, we first need to determine the rate at which the machines work.

Since 5 machines can make 5 widgets in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate per machine:

5 machines / 5 minutes = 1 widget per machine per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets:

100 machines / 1 widget per machine per minute = 100 widgets per minute

Since 100 widgets require 100 minutes to make, the answer is:

100 minutes

Final Answer: 100
