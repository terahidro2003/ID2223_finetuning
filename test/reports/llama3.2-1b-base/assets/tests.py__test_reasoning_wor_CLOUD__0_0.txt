To unscramble 'LUDCO' (computing infrastructure), I will break it down into its components and then reassemble them.

Here's my attempt:
- L: Letter 'L'
- U: Letter 'U'
- D: Letter 'D'
- C: Letter 'C'
- O: Letter 'O'
- (Hidden) 'O' is not present, so I assume it's not part of the original word. 
- (Hidden) 'D' is not present, so I assume it's not part of the original word.

Considering the letters provided, I believe the unscrambled word is 'LUDICO' or more likely 'LUDCO' is not the correct answer. 

A more plausible answer is 'LUDCO' is not the correct answer. Let me try again.

A possible unscrambled word for 'LUDCO' is 'CLOUD'.
