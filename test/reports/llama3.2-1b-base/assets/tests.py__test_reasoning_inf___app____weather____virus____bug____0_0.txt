A likely cause for your phone battery draining much faster than usual today could be a few factors:

1. **Background App Refresh**: If your phone is set to refresh background apps, it can cause your battery to drain faster. Check your phone's settings to see if this is enabled and if so, how often it's refreshed.

2. **Background App Usage**: If you've been using apps in the background, it can cause your battery to drain faster. Check your apps to see if they're running in the background and if so, how long they've been running.

3. **Low Battery Settings**: If your phone's low battery settings are enabled, it can cause your battery to drain faster. Check your phone's settings to see if low battery settings are enabled and if so, how to disable them.

4. **Power Saving Features**: If your phone has power saving features enabled, it can cause your battery to drain faster. Check your phone's settings to see if power saving features are enabled and if so, how to disable them.

5. **Battery Calibration**: If your phone's battery is not calibrated properly, it can cause your battery to drain faster. Check your phone's settings to see if battery calibration is enabled and if so, how to enable it.

To resolve the issue, you can try the following steps:

- Turn off background app refresh and background app usage.
- Disable low battery settings.
- Disable power saving features.
- Calibrate your battery by going to Settings > Battery > Calibrate.
- Check if any apps are running in the background and close them if necessary.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it may be worth contacting your phone's manufacturer or service provider for further assistance.
