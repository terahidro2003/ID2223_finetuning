Here's an example of how you can use the provided security admin functions to audit logs for the `auth-service` in the last 24 hours, filtering for failed logins:

```json
{
  "function": "audit_logs",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "time_range": "last 24 hours",
  "filter": "failed logins"
}
```

This JSON object specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to use for auditing logs. In this case, it's `audit_logs`.
- `service`: The service to audit. In this case, it's `auth-service`.
- `time_range`: The time range to audit. In this case, it's `last 24 hours`.
- `filter`: The filter to apply to the audit logs. In this case, it's `failed logins`.

When you run this JSON object, it will generate a list of audit logs for the specified service, time range, and filter. The list will include failed login attempts.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-12-30T00:00:00Z",
    "service": "auth-service",
    "action": "login",
    "user": "admin",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "failed": true
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-12-29T23:59:59Z",
    "service": "auth-service",
    "action": "login",
    "user": "admin",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "failed": true
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2023-12-28T12:00:00Z",
    "service": "auth-service",
    "action": "login",
    "user": "admin",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
    "failed": true
  }
]
```

This output shows the following:

- Two failed login attempts for the `auth-service` in the last 24 hours.
- The user and IP address for each failed login attempt.
- The timestamp for each failed login attempt.

By using this JSON object, you can easily audit logs for the specified service, time range, and filter, and get a clear view of any failed login attempts.
