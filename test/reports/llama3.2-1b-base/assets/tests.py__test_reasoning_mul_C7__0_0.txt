To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options:

A) Nucleus - The nucleus is indeed the powerhouse of the cell. It houses the cell's genetic material (DNA) and contains the cell's control center, where the cell's instructions are stored. The nucleus is the site where DNA replication occurs, and it's where the cell's genetic material is copied and transcribed into RNA.

B) Ribosome - Ribosomes are small organelles found throughout the cell, responsible for protein synthesis. They read the genetic code in the nucleus and assemble the corresponding amino acids into proteins. While ribosomes are crucial for cellular function, they are not the powerhouse of the cell.

C) Mitochondria - Mitochondria are known as the "powerhouses" of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of cellular energy. Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration, making them the powerhouse of the cell.

D) Chloroplast - Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and some algae, responsible for photosynthesis. They use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. While chloroplasts are essential for plant growth and development, they are not the powerhouse of the cell.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is A) Nucleus, and the correct answer is C) Mitochondria.
