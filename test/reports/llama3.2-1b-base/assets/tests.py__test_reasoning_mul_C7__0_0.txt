The correct answer is C) Mitochondria.

The mitochondria is often referred to as the "powerhouse" of the cell because it generates most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy. The mitochondria is responsible for producing energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration.

The other options are not correct because:

* The nucleus (A) is the control center of the cell where DNA is stored and where the cell's genetic information is managed.
* Ribosomes (B) are small organelles found throughout the cell where protein synthesis occurs.
* Chloroplasts (D) are organelles found in plant cells where photosynthesis occurs, converting light energy into chemical energy.

It's worth noting that the mitochondria is not just a single organelle, but rather a complex structure made up of many mitochondria that work together to generate energy for the cell.
