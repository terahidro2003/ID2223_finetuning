To create a B-Tree index on the `customers` table for the `email` and `phone` columns, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email_phone ON customers (email, phone);
```

This query creates an index named `idx_customers_email_phone` on the `customers` table, using the `email` and `phone` columns as the key. The `B-Tree` index is used to efficiently store and retrieve data.

Here's a breakdown of the query:

* `CREATE INDEX`: This is the command to create an index.
* `idx_customers_email_phone`: This is the name of the index.
* `ON`: This specifies the table on which the index will be created.
* `customers`: This is the name of the table.
* `(email, phone)`: This specifies the columns that will be used as the key for the index.

Note: The exact syntax may vary depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using. The above query is for PostgreSQL.

**Example Use Case:**

Suppose you have a `customers` table with the following structure:

| column_name | data_type |
|-------------|-----------|
| email        | VARCHAR(255) |
| phone        | VARCHAR(20) |

You can create the index as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
) WITH (B-tree_index ON (email, phone));
```

This will create a B-Tree index on the `customers` table, using the `email` and `phone` columns as the key.
