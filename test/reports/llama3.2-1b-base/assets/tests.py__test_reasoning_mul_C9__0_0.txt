To find the smallest prime number, we need to start with the smallest possible number that is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The smallest natural number greater than 1 is 2. However, 2 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (1 and 2).

The next natural number is 3. 3 is a prime number because it only has divisors of 1 and itself.

Therefore, the smallest prime number is 3.

Final Answer: 3
