During finals week, students in the library are likely engaging in various activities to help them prepare for the upcoming exams. Here are some possible things they might be doing:

1. **Study groups**: Students might be forming or joining study groups to collaborate with peers on their notes, textbooks, and past exams. These groups can help them review material, discuss challenging topics, and provide moral support.
2. **Review sessions**: Students might be scheduling review sessions with professors or teaching assistants to go over specific topics, ask questions, and clarify any doubts they may have.
3. **Flashcard sessions**: Many students might be creating flashcards to help them memorize key terms, concepts, and formulas. They might be reviewing these flashcards regularly to reinforce their understanding.
4. **Past exam practice**: Students might be using past exams or practice questions to test their knowledge and identify areas where they need to focus their studying.
5. **Campus events**: Libraries often host events and activities during finals week, such as study breaks, workshops, and seminars. Students might be attending these events to learn more about the material, get help from peers, or simply relax and socialize.
6. **Late-night studying**: With exams approaching, students might be studying late at night, often in the library or other quiet areas of the campus. This can help them stay focused and retain information better.
7. **Peer-to-peer learning**: Students might be learning from their peers, either by asking questions, sharing notes, or discussing challenging topics. This can be a great way to learn from others and get help when needed.
8. **Pre-exam prep**: Students might be preparing for the exams by reviewing their notes, practicing past exams, or seeking help from professors or teaching assistants.

By engaging in these activities, students can better prepare themselves for the finals and reduce stress and anxiety during the exam period.
