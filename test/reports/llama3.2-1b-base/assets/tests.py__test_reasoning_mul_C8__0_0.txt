The correct answer is C) 404.

HTTP status code 404 indicates that the requested resource could not be found. This is the standard HTTP status code for "Not Found" or "Resource Not Found".

Here's a brief explanation of each option:

A) 200 - This status code indicates "OK" or "Success". It means that the server successfully processed the request and the requested resource was found.

B) 301 - This status code indicates "Moved Temporarily" or "Moved Permanently". It means that the requested resource has been moved to a different location, and the client should redirect to that location.

D) 500 - This status code indicates "Internal Server Error" or "Gateway Timeout". It means that there was an error on the server, but it's not related to the requested resource.

So, to summarize, 404 is the correct answer for "Not Found".
