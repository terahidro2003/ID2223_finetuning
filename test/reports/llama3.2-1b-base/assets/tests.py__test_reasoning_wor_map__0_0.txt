This is a classic riddle. The answer is: "An Island".

* Cities are often built on islands.
* Forests are often found on islands.
* Water is essential for life, but it's not a living creature (fish).
* Islands typically have no houses, as they are usually uninhabited.

Well, did I "island" you with the correct answer?
