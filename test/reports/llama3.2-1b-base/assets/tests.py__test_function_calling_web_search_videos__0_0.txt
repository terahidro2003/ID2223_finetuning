Here's a search query that should yield relevant results:

```json
{
  "function": "search_videos",
  "query": "Python programming videos with long duration and HD quality",
  "duration": "long",
  "quality": "HD"
}
```

You can also add additional parameters to refine the search results. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "function": "search_videos",
  "query": "Python programming videos with long duration and HD quality",
  "duration": "long",
  "quality": "HD",
  "min_length": "30",
  "max_length": "120"
}
```

In this example, the search query is more specific and includes additional parameters:

- `min_length` and `max_length` specify the minimum and maximum length of the video content. In this case, the minimum length is 30 seconds and the maximum length is 120 seconds.

You can also use the `limit` parameter to get a specific number of results:

```json
{
  "function": "search_videos",
  "query": "Python programming videos with long duration and HD quality",
  "duration": "long",
  "quality": "HD",
  "limit": 10
}
```

This will return the top 10 results that match the search query.

Here are some sample search results:

This is just a sample of what the search results might look like. The actual results will depend on the search query and the tools used to search for videos.
