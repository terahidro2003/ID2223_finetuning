To find the distance the bird flies, we need to calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet and then use that time to find the distance the bird flies.

First, let's calculate the combined speed of the two trains:
50 mph + 50 mph = 100 mph

Since the trains are heading towards each other, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 100 miles / 100 mph
Time = 1 hour

Now, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 75 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 75 miles

So, the bird flies 75 miles.

Final Answer: 75
