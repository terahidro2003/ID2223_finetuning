To find the distance the bird flies, we need to calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet. 

Since the trains are moving towards each other, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

First, let's find the combined speed of the two trains. 
Combined speed = 50 mph + 50 mph = 100 mph.

Now, we can find the time it takes for the trains to meet:
Time = 100 miles / 100 mph = 1 hour.

Since the bird flies at 75 mph, we can multiply the time by the bird's speed to find the distance it flies:
Distance = Speed x Time = 75 mph x 1 hour = 75 miles.

So, the bird flies 75 miles.
