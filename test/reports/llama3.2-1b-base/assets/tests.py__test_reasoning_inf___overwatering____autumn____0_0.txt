To identify the issue, let's consider the following steps:

1. **Check the soil moisture**: Is the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged? If it is, it might be a sign of overwatering, which can cause roots to rot and lead to yellow leaves.

2. **Inspect the plant's environment**: Is the plant receiving sufficient light? Most plants require at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day. If the plant is not receiving enough light, it may not be able to photosynthesize, leading to yellow leaves.

3. **Check for pests**: Are there any pests like aphids, spider mites, or mealybugs on the plant? These pests can cause yellow leaves by sucking the sap from the plant.

4. **Adjust watering schedule**: Are you watering the plant more frequently than usual? If so, it might be a sign of overwatering.

5. **Consider nutrient deficiencies**: Are there any nutrient deficiencies in the soil? For example, if the soil lacks nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium, it can cause yellow leaves.

6. **Check for temperature**: Is the temperature suitable for the plant? Most plants prefer daytime temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) and nighttime temperatures around 55-65°F (13-18°C).

7. **Inspect the plant's health**: Are there any signs of disease or pests on the plant? If so, it's essential to address the issue promptly.

8. **Consult the plant's care manual**: Check the plant's care manual or online resources for specific guidance on caring for the plant.

9. **Consider repotting**: If the plant is pot-bound, it might be time to repot it in a larger container with fresh, well-draining soil.

10. **Monitor the plant's growth**: Keep a close eye on the plant's growth and adjust its care accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the likely cause of the yellow leaves on your plant.
