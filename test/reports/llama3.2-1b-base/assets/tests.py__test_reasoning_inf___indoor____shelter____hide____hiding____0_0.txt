Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Weather Conditions**: The movie theater is packed on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Rainy weather can make people stay indoors, reducing the number of people going out to watch a movie.

2. **Movie Theater's Capacity**: The movie theater has a limited capacity, which is usually determined by the theater's management. This capacity is often set to ensure that the theater can accommodate its regular patrons without overcrowding.

3. **Demand for Movie Tickets**: The demand for movie tickets is high on a rainy Saturday afternoon. People might be looking for a way to spend their Saturday indoors, and a movie is a popular activity for families and couples.

4. **Limited Availability of Movie Theaters**: On a rainy Saturday afternoon, the number of movie theaters in the area might be limited. This could be due to various factors such as the theater's location, the number of screens, or the availability of seats.

5. **Convenience and Comfort**: The rainy weather might make people prefer the comfort and convenience of staying indoors rather than venturing out to a crowded movie theater.

6. **Marketing Strategy**: The movie theater might have a marketing strategy in place to attract customers on a rainy Saturday afternoon. This could include offering discounts, promotions, or special deals to attract more customers.

7. **Customer Behavior**: On a rainy Saturday afternoon, customers might be more likely to stay home and watch a movie rather than venturing out to a crowded movie theater. This is because they might be more inclined to relax and enjoy the movie indoors.

8. **Behavioral Patterns**: People tend to follow behavioral patterns, and on a rainy Saturday afternoon, they might be more inclined to stay home and watch a movie rather than going out to a crowded movie theater.

Considering these factors, it's likely that the movie theater is packed on a rainy Saturday afternoon due to a combination of factors, including high demand for movie tickets, limited availability of movie theaters, marketing strategy, and customer behavior.
