I'll simulate an IoT device manager request. Here's the output in JSON format:

```json
{
    "function": "camera_snapshot",
    "camera_id": "front_door",
    "quality": "high"
}
```

This request will take a high-quality snapshot from the camera located at the front door. The quality of the snapshot can be adjusted using the `quality` parameter. In this case, the quality is set to "high".
