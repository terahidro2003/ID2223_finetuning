To find the number of sheep left, we need to subtract the number of sheep that died from the total number of sheep.

First, let's find the number of sheep that died:
17 (total sheep) - 9 (sheep that died) = 8

Now, let's subtract the number of sheep that died from the total number of sheep:
17 (total sheep) - 8 (sheep that died) = 9

So, the number of sheep left is 9.

Final Answer: 9
