Here's how you can configure logging for the payment-service at INFO level with 90 day retention using the provided tools:

```bash
# Create a healthcheck
create_healthcheck:
  endpoint: /healthcheck
  interval_seconds: 30
  timeout: 60

# Configure logging
configure_logging:
  service: payment-service
  level: INFO
  retention_days: 90
```

In the above command, we are creating a healthcheck with the following settings:

- `endpoint`: The healthcheck endpoint is `/healthcheck`.
- `interval_seconds`: The interval between healthchecks is 30 seconds.
- `timeout`: The timeout for the healthcheck is 60 seconds.

We are then configuring logging for the payment-service at the INFO level with a retention period of 90 days. The `level` parameter is set to `INFO`, which corresponds to the INFO level in the logging hierarchy. The `retention_days` parameter is set to 90, which means that logs will be retained for 90 days before they are automatically deleted.

To use this command, you would need to have the `create_healthcheck` and `configure_logging` tools installed and configured on your system. The exact commands and parameters may vary depending on the specific tools and environments you are using.
