To solve this, let's analyze the given letters: W-I-R-E.

1. We start with the letters W-I-R-E.
2. Adding two letters to the beginning of the word, we get W-I-R-E-T.
3. Adding two letters to the end of the word, we get W-I-R-E-T-O.

Since the word is "WIRE" and we added two letters to the beginning and the end, the correct answer is: W-I-R-E-T-O.
