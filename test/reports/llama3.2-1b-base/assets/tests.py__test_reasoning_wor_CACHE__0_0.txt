To unscramble 'HCECA', let's break it down step by step:

1. Start with the letters: H-C-E-C-A
2. Look for common letters: 'H' and 'C' are present.
3. Identify the 'E' and 'A' positions: 'E' is in the second position and 'A' is in the last position.
4. Since 'A' is in the last position, it's likely that 'A' is the last letter of the original word.
5. The word 'HCECA' ends with 'A', so the correct unscrambled word is 'HECACA'.
