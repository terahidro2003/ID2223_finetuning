To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of cats needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes.

Since 5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of cats needed to catch 1 mouse in 1 minute. 

5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes = 1 mouse in 1 minute
5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes = 1 mouse in 5 minutes
5 cats catch 5 mice in 5 minutes = 1 mouse in 25 minutes

Now, we need to find the number of cats needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes. 

100 mice / 25 minutes = 4 cats needed to catch 100 mice in 100 minutes

Final Answer: 4
