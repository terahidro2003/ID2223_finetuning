Here's an example of how you can use the Cloud Resource Manager to allocate 500GB SSD storage mounted at `/data`:

```yml
resources:
  - name: allocate_storage
    function: allocate_storage
    parameters:
      size_gb: 500
      type: SSD
      mount_point: /data
```

This YAML file defines a single resource called `allocate_storage`. It specifies the following:

- `function`: The function to use for the resource. In this case, we're using the `allocate_storage` function.
- `parameters`: The parameters to pass to the function. We're specifying the following:
  - `size_gb`: The size of the storage in GB. We're setting this to 500.
  - `type`: The type of storage. We're setting this to `SSD`.
  - `mount_point`: The mount point for the storage. We're setting this to `/data`.

When you run this YAML file, it will create a new resource called `allocate_storage` and allocate 500GB SSD storage mounted at `/data`.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```yml
{
  "id": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account-id:instance/allocate-storage",
  "status": "Created",
  "created_at": "2023-12-01T12:00:00Z",
  "description": "allocate_storage"
}
```

You can then use the `allocate_storage` function to create the resource programmatically. Here's an example:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='region_name')

response = ec2.allocate_storage(
    SizeGB=500,
    Type='SSD',
    MountPoint='/data'
)

print(response)
```

This code will create a new resource called `allocate_storage` and allocate 500GB SSD storage mounted at `/data`.
