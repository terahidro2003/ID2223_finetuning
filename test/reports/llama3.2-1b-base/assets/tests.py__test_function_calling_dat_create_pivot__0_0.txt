To create a pivot table from `sales_data` with `product` as rows, `quarter` as columns, and `revenue` as values, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
  product,
  quarter,
  SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM 
  sales_data
GROUP BY 
  product,
  quarter
ORDER BY 
  product,
  quarter;
```

This query will create a pivot table with the following structure:

| product | quarter | total_revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1 | 1000.00 |
| A | 2 | 1200.00 |
| B | 1 | 800.00 |
| B | 2 | 1000.00 |

Here's a breakdown of the query:

- `SELECT product, quarter, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue FROM sales_data GROUP BY product, quarter ORDER BY product, quarter;`
  - `product` and `quarter` are the columns that will be grouped together.
  - `SUM(revenue)` calculates the total revenue for each group.
  - `GROUP BY product, quarter` groups the data by `product` and `quarter`.
  - `ORDER BY product, quarter` sorts the data by `product` and `quarter`.

Note: This query assumes that the `sales_data` table has the following structure:

| product | quarter | revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1 | 1000.00 |
| A | 2 | 1200.00 |
| B | 1 | 800.00 |
| B | 2 | 1000.00 |

If your data has a different structure, you may need to adjust the query accordingly.
