To analyze the sentiment of the text "This product is amazing!" using the VADER model, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Download the VADER lexicon if not already downloaded
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

# Initialize the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze the sentiment of the text
text = "This product is amazing!"
sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)

# Print the sentiment scores
print("Sentiment Scores:")
print(f"  - Positive: {sentiment['pos']:.2f}%")
print(f"  - Neutral: {sentiment['neu']:.2f}%")
print(f"  - Negative: {sentiment['neg']:.2f}%")

# Determine the sentiment based on the scores
if sentiment['pos'] > sentiment['neu'] + sentiment['neg']:
    sentiment_type = "Positive"
elif sentiment['neu'] > sentiment['pos'] + sentiment['neg']:
    sentiment_type = "Neutral"
else:
    sentiment_type = "Negative"

# Print the sentiment type
print(f"\nSentiment Type: {sentiment_type}")
```

This code will output the sentiment scores, determine the sentiment type based on the scores, and print the sentiment type.

When you run this code, it will output something like this:

```
Sentiment Scores:
  - Positive: 85.0%
  - Neutral: 12.0%
  - Negative: 3.0%

Sentiment Type: Positive
```

This indicates that the text has a high positive sentiment score, which suggests that the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive.
