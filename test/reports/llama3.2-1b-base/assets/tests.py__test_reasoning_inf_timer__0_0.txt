Based on the information provided, it's likely that the neighbor's house lights are using a smart home system. Here's a possible scenario:

The neighbor's house is equipped with smart home devices, such as thermostats, lights, and security cameras. The smart home system allows them to control these devices remotely using a smartphone app or voice assistant.

When the neighbor is on vacation, they may have left their smart home system in manual mode, which means the lights are not being controlled remotely. Instead, the smart home system is set to a default schedule, which includes turning the lights on and off at different times each evening.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The neighbor may have forgotten to set the smart home system to manual mode.
2. The neighbor may have set the smart home system to a default schedule that they are not familiar with.
3. The neighbor may have left the smart home system in a mode that they are not comfortable with.

To resolve the issue, the neighbor could try the following:

1. Check the smart home system's manual or online documentation to see if there are any settings or modes that can be changed.
2. Contact the smart home system's manufacturer or customer support to see if they can assist with the issue.
3. If the neighbor is not comfortable with the smart home system, they could consider setting it to manual mode or using a different smart home system that allows for more control over the lighting schedule.
