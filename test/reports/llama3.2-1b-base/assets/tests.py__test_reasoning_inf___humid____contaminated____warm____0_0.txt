To determine the likely cause of the moldy bread, let's consider the following factors:

1. **Time**: The bread was bought only 2 days ago. This suggests that the mold growth is likely due to a relatively short period of time.
2. **Storage conditions**: The bread was stored at room temperature, which is a common storage condition for bread.
3. **Moisture**: The bread was stored in a humid environment, which can contribute to mold growth.

Considering these factors, here are a few possible causes of moldy bread:

* **Over-ripening**: The bread may have been stored for too long, causing it to over-ripen and develop mold.
* **Poor storage**: The bread may have been stored in a way that allowed moisture to enter the container, leading to mold growth.
* **Contamination**: The bread may have been contaminated with mold spores from another source, such as a nearby bakery or a contaminated storage container.

To further investigate, you may want to check the bread for any visible signs of mold, such as a white or greenish discoloration. If you're still unsure, you can try to identify the type of mold that's growing on the bread.
