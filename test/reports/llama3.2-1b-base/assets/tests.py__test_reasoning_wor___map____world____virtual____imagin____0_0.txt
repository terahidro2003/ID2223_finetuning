To solve this riddle, let's analyze each statement:

1. Cities: You have cities, but you don't have houses. This means you have cities but not houses.
2. Forests: You have forests, but you don't have trees. This means you have forests but not trees.
3. Water: You have water, but you don't have fish. This means you have water but not fish.

Since the statements are mutually exclusive (you can't have both cities and houses, forests and trees, and water and fish), the answer is not a city, a forest, or a body of water. However, the answer is not a city, a forest, or a body of water either.

After some thought, I think I have it: you are a map. A map is a representation of a real-world location, but it doesn't show the actual location itself. It's a city, a forest, or a body of water, but not the actual thing.
