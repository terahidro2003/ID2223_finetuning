To identify the bottleneck, let's analyze the situation:

1. The website loads slowly only during business hours.
2. The website is a typical web application with multiple users accessing it simultaneously.
3. The website is hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure, which suggests that scalability and high availability are key considerations.

Based on these points, I would suggest that the bottleneck is likely the database or the underlying storage system.

Here's why:

- During business hours, the website is likely to be accessing a large number of users, which can put a strain on the database or storage system.
- The slow loading of the website during business hours suggests that the database or storage system is not handling the load efficiently.
- The fact that the website is a typical web application with multiple users accessing it simultaneously suggests that the bottleneck is likely to be related to the database or storage system, rather than the web application itself.

To further investigate, I would recommend the following steps:

- Monitor the database or storage system's performance during business hours to see if there are any bottlenecks.
- Check the database or storage system's configuration and settings to see if there are any issues.
- Consider implementing load balancing or caching to improve the website's performance during business hours.

Final Answer: The bottleneck is likely the database or the underlying storage system, which is not handling the load efficiently during business hours.
