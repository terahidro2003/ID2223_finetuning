To find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to calculate the position of each hand in terms of degrees.

The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, which is 30 degrees per hour. Since the time is 3:15, the hour hand has moved 3 hours and 15 minutes.

3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 degrees. Adding the 15 minutes, we get 180 + 0.25 = 180.25 degrees.

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which is 6 degrees per minute. Since the time is 3:15, the minute hand has moved 15 * 6 = 90 degrees.

Now, we need to find the angle between the two hands. The angle between the hour and minute hands is the difference between their positions.

Angle = 180.25 - 90 = 90 degrees.

So, the angle between the hour and minute hands is 90 degrees.
