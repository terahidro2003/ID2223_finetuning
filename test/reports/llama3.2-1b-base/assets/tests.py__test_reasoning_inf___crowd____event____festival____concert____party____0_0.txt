To anticipate what authorities might be expecting, here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Trash collection schedule**: Authorities are likely to have a regular trash collection schedule in place, which includes regular pickups of trash and recyclables.
2. **Increased waste**: With the extra trash bins installed, authorities might anticipate an increase in the amount of trash generated in the park.
3. **Potential for overflow**: The extra bins might lead to a potential overflow of trash, which could be a concern for park maintenance and cleanliness.
4. **Increased maintenance**: Authorities might anticipate increased maintenance and upkeep of the trash bins to ensure they remain clean and functional.
5. **Potential for contamination**: With more trash being generated, there's a higher risk of contamination in the park, which could affect the quality of the environment and public health.

Considering these factors, authorities might be anticipating increased waste management, maintenance, and potential contamination issues in the park.
