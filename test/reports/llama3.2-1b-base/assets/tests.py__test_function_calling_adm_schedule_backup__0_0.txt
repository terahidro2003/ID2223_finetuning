Here's an example of how you can schedule daily backups for the "customer-data" resource with a 30-day retention period using the provided tools:

```json
"function": "schedule_backup",
"resource": "customer-data",
"frequency": "daily",
"retention": "30",
"destination": "backup-store",
"source": "customer-data",
"type": "daily"
```

This JSON object defines the following:

- `function`: The function to be used for scheduling the backup. In this case, it's `schedule_backup`.
- `resource`: The resource to be backed up. In this case, it's "customer-data".
- `frequency`: The frequency of the backup. In this case, it's "daily".
- `retention`: The retention period for the backup. In this case, it's "30" days.
- `destination`: The destination for the backup. In this case, it's "backup-store".
- `source`: The source for the backup. In this case, it's "customer-data".
- `type`: The type of backup. In this case, it's "daily".

You can also specify the backup type, such as `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`, depending on your needs.

To use this tool, you would need to:

1. Create a backup manager instance.
2. Call the `schedule_backup` function with the required parameters.
3. The backup manager will schedule the backup for the specified resource, frequency, and retention period.

Here's an example of how you can call this function:

```javascript
const backupManager = new BackupManager();
const backup = await backupManager.scheduleBackup({
  function: 'schedule_backup',
  resource: 'customer-data',
  frequency: 'daily',
  retention: '30',
  destination: 'backup-store',
  source: 'customer-data',
  type: 'daily'
});
```

This code creates a new instance of the `BackupManager` class and calls the `schedule_backup` function with the required parameters. The backup manager will then schedule the backup for the specified resource, frequency, and retention period.
