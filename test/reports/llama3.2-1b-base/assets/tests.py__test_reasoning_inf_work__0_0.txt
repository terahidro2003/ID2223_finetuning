This pattern is an example of a phenomenon called "peak hour" or "peak time" in the context of human behavior and psychology. Here's what's happening:

1. **Peak hour**: At 6 AM, the gym is full, which means that the majority of people have just arrived and are waiting to start their workouts. This is the peak hour, where the gym is at its busiest.
2. **Half-empty at noon**: At 12 PM, the gym is half-empty, which means that the majority of people have left the gym for the day. This is the off-peak hour, where the gym is at its quietest.

There are several psychological and sociological factors that contribute to this pattern:

* **Social norms**: People tend to congregate in certain areas, such as gyms, during peak hours. This is because people often follow social norms and conventions, and gyms are a common gathering place for people who want to exercise or socialize.
* **Time perception**: People tend to overestimate the time it takes to complete a task, such as going to the gym. This is known as the "time distortion" effect. As a result, people tend to arrive at the gym earlier than they need to, leading to a full gym at 6 AM.
* **Loss aversion**: People tend to fear missing out (FOMO) on the gym's peak hours. This means that people are more likely to arrive early and wait in line, rather than taking the risk of missing out on a good workout.
* **Convenience**: Gyms are often located in convenient locations, such as near highways or busy streets. This makes it easy for people to arrive early and take advantage of the gym's peak hours.
* **Psychological comfort**: Arriving early to the gym can provide a psychological sense of comfort and security. People may feel more confident and prepared to tackle their workouts, which can lead to a more enjoyable experience.

These factors combined create the pattern of a full gym at 6 AM and a half-empty gym at noon.
