There are several reasons why the coffee shop has a long line at 8 AM on Monday but is nearly empty at 2 PM. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Peak morning demand**: Monday mornings are often busy for many people, especially those with long commutes or early workdays. The coffee shop may be catering to this demand, with customers seeking a quick caffeine boost to get through the day.
2. **Limited hours**: The coffee shop may only be open from 8 AM to 2 PM, which means that many customers are limited to this time slot. This could be due to a small number of regular customers who come in during this time, or a limited number of employees who are only available during this period.
3. **Limited seating or amenities**: The coffee shop may not have enough seating or amenities to accommodate a large number of customers. This could be due to a small number of tables or chairs, or a limited selection of seating areas.
4. **Limited hours for non-employees**: The coffee shop may only be open to employees, which means that customers who are not employees (e.g. students, freelancers) are not welcome. This could be due to a policy of not serving customers who are not employees.
