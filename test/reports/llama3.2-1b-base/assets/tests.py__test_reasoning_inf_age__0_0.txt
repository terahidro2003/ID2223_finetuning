There are several factors that could have caused the yellowing and brittleness of a book's pages, despite being kept indoors. Here are some possible causes:

1. **Moisture**: Even if the book is kept indoors, moisture can still seep into the pages through cracks in the cover, gaps in the binding, or exposure to high humidity. This can cause the paper to yellow, become brittle, or develop mold and mildew.
2. **Light exposure**: Direct sunlight can cause the yellowing of pages, as it can break down the pigments in the paper. Even indirect sunlight can cause some yellowing, especially if the book is not properly stored.
3. **Temperature fluctuations**: Changes in temperature can cause the paper to degrade, leading to yellowing and brittleness. If the book is stored in a room with extreme temperature fluctuations, this could be a contributing factor.
4. **Humidity**: High humidity can cause the paper to become brittle and yellow. This is especially true if the book is stored in a humid environment, such as a basement or attic.
5. **Fungal growth**: Fungi can grow on the pages of a book, especially if it is not properly stored. This can cause the pages to yellow, become brittle, or develop mold and mildew.
6. **Chemical contamination**: Chemicals like ink, paint, or other substances can contaminate the pages of a book, causing them to yellow or become brittle.
7. **Physical damage**: Physical damage to the book, such as creasing, folding, or bending, can cause the pages to become brittle and yellow.
8. **Age**: As books age, the paper can become brittle and yellow due to the natural aging process.

To prevent these issues, it's essential to store books properly, including:

* Keeping the book away from direct sunlight and high temperatures
* Maintaining a consistent humidity level
* Storing the book in a cool, dry place
* Avoiding physical damage to the book
* Regularly inspecting the book for signs of damage or deterioration

By taking these precautions, you can help preserve the condition of your books and keep them in good condition for years to come.
