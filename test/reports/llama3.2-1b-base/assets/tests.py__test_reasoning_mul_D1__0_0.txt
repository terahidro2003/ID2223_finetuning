Russia has 11 time zones, ranging from UTC+2 (Arctic Time) to UTC+12 (Arctic Time + 12 hours). This is due to the country's vast geographical range, from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost parts of the country.

Here's a breakdown of the time zones in Russia:

* UTC+2 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+3 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+4 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+5 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+6 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+7 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast

* UTC+9 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+10 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
* UTC+11 (Arctic Time): Murmansk Oblast
