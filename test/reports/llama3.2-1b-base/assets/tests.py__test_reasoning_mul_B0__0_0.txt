The correct answer is B) Mars.

Mars is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (or rust) in the planet's soil. This iron oxide is a result of the planet's iron-rich composition and the presence of water, which has led to the formation of iron oxides over time.

Venus is often referred to as the "Earthly Twin" due to its similar size and mass, but it is much hotter and has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.

Jupiter is a gas giant planet, and it is not known for its reddish appearance. Jupiter is a massive planet with a thick atmosphere, but it does not have any iron oxide or rust in its soil.

Saturn is also a gas giant planet, and it is not known for its reddish appearance. Saturn is a beautiful planet with stunning ring systems, but it does not have any iron oxide or rust in its soil.

So, the correct answer is Mars!
