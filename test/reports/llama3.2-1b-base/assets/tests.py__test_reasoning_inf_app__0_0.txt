A likely cause for your phone battery draining much faster than usual today could be:

1. **Background App Refresh**: Many apps on your phone continue to run in the background, even when you're not actively using them. This can cause your battery to drain faster as the apps continue to consume power.
2. **Background Data**: If you've accessed or downloaded any apps or services in the past few hours, they may still be running in the background, consuming power.
3. **Resource Intensive Apps**: If you've installed or opened resource-intensive apps, such as video editing software or games, they may be consuming more power than usual.
4. **Low Battery Settings**: If your phone's low battery settings are set to "Optimize Battery" or "Optimize Battery Usage", it may be trying to optimize battery usage by closing unnecessary apps or services, which can cause your battery to drain faster.
5. **Third-Party Apps**: If you've installed any third-party apps, they may be consuming power in the background, causing your battery to drain faster.

To troubleshoot the issue, you can try:

* Closing unnecessary apps and services
* Disabling background app refresh and background data
* Checking your phone's battery settings and adjusting them as needed
* Restarting your phone to see if the issue persists

If the issue persists, you may want to consider restarting your phone or visiting a authorized service center for further assistance.
