To join the `customers` and `orders` tables on the `customer_id` column, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

This query will return all columns (`*`) from both the `customers` and `orders` tables, where the `customer_id` column in `customers` matches the `customer_id` column in `orders`.

Here's an example of the output:

| customer_id | customer_name | order_id | order_total |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| 1           | John Smith     | 1        | 100.00      |
| 1           | John Smith     | 2        | 200.00      |
| 2           | Jane Doe       | 3        | 50.00       |
| 3           | Bob Johnson    | 4        | 150.00      |

Note: The actual output will depend on the data in your tables. This query assumes that the `customer_id` column is present in both tables and that the join is done on the exact match. If there are any discrepancies, the query will return those rows.
