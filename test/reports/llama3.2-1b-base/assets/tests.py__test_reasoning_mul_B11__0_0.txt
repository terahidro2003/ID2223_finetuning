The correct answer is A) Factory.

The Factory design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance. It creates an object without specifying the type of object that will be created. The Factory pattern is used to create objects without specifying the type of object.

Here's an example of the Factory pattern in action:

```java
public class AnimalFactory {
    public static Animal createAnimal(String type) {
        if (type.equals("dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (type.equals("cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
}

public class Dog {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AnimalFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of `Dog` and `Cat` classes. The `createAnimal` method takes a string parameter `type` and returns an instance of the corresponding class. The `AnimalFactory` class ensures that there is only one instance of `Dog` and `Cat` classes, as they are created only once.

The other options are not correct:

* B) Singleton: A Singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance. However, it does not guarantee that the instance is thread-safe.
* C) Observer: The Observer pattern is used to notify objects about changes to other objects. It does not ensure that a class has only one instance.
* D) Strategy: The Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, so they can be used interchangeably. It does not ensure that a class has only one instance.
