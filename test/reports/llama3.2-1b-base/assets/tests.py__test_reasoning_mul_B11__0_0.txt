To solve this problem, we need to identify the design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance.

The correct answer is: B) Singleton

Here's why:

A singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance. It achieves this by making the class itself a singleton, i.e., it has a single instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Here's a simple example of a singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a private constructor, which means it can only be instantiated once. The `getInstance()` method checks if an instance of the class already exists. If not, it creates a new instance and assigns it to the `instance` variable. If an instance already exists, it returns the existing instance.

This design pattern is useful when you need to access a class instance from multiple threads or multiple locations, as it ensures that only one instance is created.

The other options are not correct because:

A) Factory: A factory design pattern is used to create objects, but it does not ensure that a class has only one instance.

C) Observer: An observer design pattern is used to notify objects about events, but it does not ensure that a class has only one instance.

D) Strategy: A strategy design pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, but it does not ensure that a class has only one instance.
