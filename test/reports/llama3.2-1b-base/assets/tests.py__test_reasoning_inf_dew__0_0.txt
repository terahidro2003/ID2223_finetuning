To find the most likely explanation, let's consider the given information:

1. The field is filled with grass.
2. The field is wet.
3. It didn't rain last night.
4. No sprinklers were on.

Considering these points, here's a possible explanation:

The most likely explanation is that the field is filled with water from a nearby source, such as a pond, lake, or even a nearby stream. This could be due to a natural phenomenon like a storm drain or a nearby water source. Since it didn't rain last night, it's possible that the water is coming from a different source.

Another possibility is that the field is filled with water from a nearby water source, such as a well or a borehole. However, this would require some investigation to confirm.

In either case, the fact that the field is wet and the grass is wet suggests that the water is coming from a nearby source, rather than a rainwater collection system or a nearby water source.

Final Answer: The most likely explanation is that the field is filled with water from a nearby source, such as a pond, lake, or nearby stream.
