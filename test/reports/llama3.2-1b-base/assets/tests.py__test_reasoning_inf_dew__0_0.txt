Given that it didn't rain last night and there are no sprinklers, here are a few possible explanations for the wet ground:

1. **Leaking pipes or water main**: Although it's unlikely, it's possible that the pipes under your home or building are leaking, causing water to seep into the ground. Check your pipes and water main to see if there are any signs of leaks.
2. **Condensation or frost**: In temperate climates, condensation can occur when warm air meets a cool surface, causing water vapor to condense on the ground. This can happen even if it didn't rain, as the ground can still be warm from the previous day's heat.
3. **Groundwater table**: If the soil is saturated with water, it can seep into the ground and cause the surface to become wet. This is more likely to happen in areas with a high water table or where the soil is prone to waterlogging.
4. **Poor drainage**: If the ground is not draining properly, water can collect and seep into the ground. This can be due to a variety of factors, including poor drainage, compacted soil, or a lack of vegetation to absorb excess water.
5. **Animal activity**: Animals, such as rodents or birds, can cause damage to pipes, vents, or other infrastructure that can lead to water seepage into the ground.

To investigate further, you can try the following:

* Check your pipes and water main for any signs of leaks.
* Inspect your home's foundation and walls for any signs of water damage.
* Look for any signs of animal activity, such as droppings or nests.
* Check the soil and drainage around your home to see if there are any signs of waterlogging.

It's always a good idea to consult with a professional, such as a plumber or a water damage expert, to determine the cause of the wet ground and to get it fixed.
