To forecast the next 6 periods for `stock_prices` using an ARIMA model, we'll use the `forecast_values` function from the `statsmodels` library in Python. Here's the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Load the stock prices data
stock_prices = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])

# Convert the 'Date' column to datetime
stock_prices['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stock_prices['Date'])

# Set the 'Date' column as the index
stock_prices.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Plot the stock prices
stock_prices.plot(figsize=(20, 10))

# Decompose the series
decomposition = stock_prices.decompose()

# Print the decomposition
print(decomposition)

# Detect seasonality
detect_seasonality(stock_prices, 'stock_prices', period=30)

# Forecast the next 6 periods
forecast = ARIMA(stock_prices, order=(1,1,1), seasonal=0).fit()
forecast_values = forecast.forecast(steps=6)

# Print the forecast
print(forecast_values)
```

This code will load the stock prices data, decompose it, detect seasonality, and then forecast the next 6 periods using an ARIMA model with a seasonal order of (1,1,1). The `forecast_values` function will return a pandas Series with the forecast values.

Please note that you need to have the `statsmodels` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

Also, make sure to replace `'stock_prices.csv'` with the actual path to your stock prices CSV file.
