The expansion of mobile phone usage to tens of millions of women in the developing world has significant contributions to economic development, particularly in reducing poverty and promoting economic growth. Here are some potential effects:

1. **Increased Access to Financial Services**: Mobile phones have enabled women to access financial services, such as mobile banking, savings, and remittances, which are essential for economic development. Mobile banking, in particular, allows women to manage their finances, make transactions, and save money, promoting financial inclusion.
2. **Improved Communication and Market Access**: Mobile phones facilitate communication and market access, enabling women to access information, purchase goods and services, and sell their products more easily. This improves their economic opportunities and reduces transaction costs.
3. **Enhanced Entrepreneurial Opportunities**: Mobile phones have created new opportunities for women to start and manage small businesses, such as selling products online, offering services, or creating value-added products. This promotes entrepreneurship and economic growth.
4. **Increased Economic Participation**: Mobile phones have enabled women to participate more actively in the economy, including in formal and informal sectors. This increases their economic contributions and reduces their reliance on traditional sources of income, such as subsistence farming.
5. **Reduced Poverty**: By increasing access to financial services, improving communication, and promoting entrepreneurship, mobile phones have helped reduce poverty among women in developing countries. A study by the World Bank found that every dollar invested in mobile phone services can generate up to $3 in economic benefits.
6. **Improved Health and Education**: Mobile phones have also improved access to health and education services, enabling women to access medical care, educational resources, and social services more easily. This can lead to better health outcomes, improved education, and reduced poverty.
7. **Increased Economic Empowerment**: Mobile phones have empowered women to make informed decisions about their economic lives, including investments, savings, and credit. This has led to increased economic independence and reduced vulnerability to poverty.
8. **Job Creation and Economic Growth**: The mobile phone industry has created jobs and stimulated economic growth in countries where mobile phone usage has expanded rapidly. This has contributed to increased GDP growth, reduced unemployment, and improved living standards.
9. **Reduced Inequality**: Mobile phones have helped reduce income inequality by providing women with access to economic opportunities, education, and health services. This has helped reduce poverty and improved living standards for women and their families.
10. **Long-term Effects**: The long-term effects of mobile phone usage on poverty reduction and economic growth are likely to be significant. By increasing access to financial services, improving communication, and promoting entrepreneurship, mobile phones have created a foundation for sustainable economic development.

However, it is essential to note that the impact of mobile phone usage on poverty reduction and economic growth also depends on factors such as:

* The availability and affordability of mobile phone services
* The quality of infrastructure and network coverage
* The availability of financial services and credit
* The effectiveness of mobile phone-based programs and services
* The level of institutional and regulatory support

Overall, the expansion of mobile phone usage to tens of millions of women in the developing world has contributed significantly to economic development, poverty reduction, and economic growth, with long-term effects that can help create a more equitable and prosperous society.
