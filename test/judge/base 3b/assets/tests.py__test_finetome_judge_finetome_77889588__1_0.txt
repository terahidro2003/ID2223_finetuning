Step 1:  To find the factorial of a number N, we need to multiply all the numbers in the range from 1 to N.
Step 2:  We can start by initializing a variable to store the factorial and set it to the value of N initially.
Step 3:  Then, we can iterate through the range from N-1 down to 1 and multiply the factorial by each number.
Step 4:  After the iteration, we can print the factorial as the result.
```python
# Step 5:  Read the input N as an integer.
num = int(input())
# Step 6:  Initialize a variable to store the factorial and set it to the value of N initially.
fact = num
# Step 7:  Iterate through the range from N-1 down to 1 and multiply the factorial by each number to find the factorial.
for i in range(num-1, 1, -1):
	fact *= i
# Step 8:  Print the factorial as the result.
print(fact)

```
