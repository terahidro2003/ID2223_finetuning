The response provided a generator function to reverse a given string, which is in line with the instruction. However, it lacks the depth and clarity that would make it more helpful and understandable. The function is correct but does not explain how it works or why it is efficient. It also does not provide any context or examples that could help the user understand how to use the function. The explanation of the arguments and return type is minimal, and the function's behavior is not thoroughly explained. Therefore, while the response is mostly correct, it could be improved by providing more detailed explanations and examples.
