[Reasoning]
To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Python's built-in data structures and algorithms. We'll create a function that takes a list of words as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the n-grams and the values are their corresponding frequencies.

[Implementation]
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import permutations

def n_gram_frequency(words, n):
    """
    Count the frequency of each n-gram in a given list of words.

    Args:
        words (list): A list of words.
        n (int): The size of the n-grams.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the n-grams and the values are their corresponding frequencies.
    """
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each n-gram
    frequency = defaultdict(int)

    # Generate all possible n-grams
    for gram in permutations(words, n):
        # Join the words in the n-gram to create a string
        n_gram = ''.join(gram)
        # Increment the frequency of the n-gram
        frequency[n_gram] += 1

    return dict(frequency)
```

[Explanation]
This function works by generating all possible n-grams from the input list of words using the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module. It then increments the frequency of each n-gram by 1 and stores it in the `frequency` dictionary. Finally, it returns the `frequency` dictionary as a regular dictionary.

[Tests]
You can write the following test cases to ensure it works correctly:

```python
import unittest

class TestNGramFrequency(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_n_gram_frequency(self):
        words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
        n = 2
        expected_output = {
            'apple banana': 1,
            'banana cherry': 1,
            'cherry date': 1,
            'date elderberry': 1,
            'apple banana cherry': 1,
            'apple banana date': 1,
            'apple banana elderberry': 1,
            'banana cherry date': 1,
            'banana cherry elderberry': 1,
            'banana date elderberry': 1,
            'cherry date elderberry': 1,
            'apple banana cherry date': 1,
            'apple banana cherry elderberry': 1,
            'apple banana date elderberry': 1,
            'banana cherry date elderberry': 1,
        }
        self.assertEqual(n_gram_frequency(words, n), expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These test cases cover a variety of n-grams and ensure that the function is working correctly.
