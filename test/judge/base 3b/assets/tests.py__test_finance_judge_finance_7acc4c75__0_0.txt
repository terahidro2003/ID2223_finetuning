This contract includes the following functionality:

1.  **Adding Liquidity**: The `addLiquidity` function allows a liquidity provider to add liquidity to a token. It ensures that the liquidity provider can only add liquidity, and the amount of liquidity added cannot exceed 10^18.
2.  **Removing Liquidity**: The `removeLiquidity` function allows a liquidity provider to remove liquidity from a token. It ensures that the liquidity provider can only remove liquidity, and the amount of liquidity removed must be less than or equal to the amount of liquidity added.
3.  **Obtaining Quotes**: The `obtainQuote` function allows a liquidity provider to obtain a quote for a token. It ensures that the liquidity provider can only obtain a quote, and the amount of liquidity must be greater than or equal to the requested amount.
4.  **Swapping Tokens**: The `swapTokens` function allows a liquidity provider to swap tokens. It ensures that the liquidity provider can only swap tokens, and the amount of liquidity must be greater than or equal to the requested amount.
5.  **Setting Liquidity Providers**: The `setLiquidityProvider` function allows the contract to set a liquidity provider for a token. It ensures that the liquidity provider must have a non-zero amount of liquidity.
6.  **Withdrawing Liquidity**: The `withdrawLiquidity` function allows a liquidity provider to withdraw liquidity from a token. It ensures that the liquidity provider can only withdraw liquidity, and the amount of liquidity must be greater than 0.

This contract uses the following data structures:

*   `tokenReserves`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective reserves.
*   `tokenReservesLiquidity`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective reserves for liquidity.
*   `tokenQuotePrices`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective quote prices.
*   `tokenSwapFees`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective swap fees.
*   `tokenSwapFeesLiquidity`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective swap fees for liquidity.
*   `tokenLiquidityProviders`: A mapping of token addresses to their respective liquidity providers.

This contract emits the following events:

*   `AddLiquidity`: Emitted when liquidity is added to a token.
*   `RemoveLiquidity`: Emitted when liquidity is removed from a token.
*   `ObtainQuote`: Emitted when a quote is obtained for a token.
*   `SwapTokens`: Emitted when a token is swapped.
*   `SetLiquidityProvider`: Emitted when a liquidity provider is set for a token.
*   `WithdrawLiquidity`: Emitted when liquidity is withdrawn from a token.
