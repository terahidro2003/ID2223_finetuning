The response provided is mostly accurate and helpful, aligning well with the instruction given. It includes all the necessary details such as the house number, street, city, postal code, state, and country. However, it could have been more comprehensive by including the additional context about the Botanical Gardens and the potential confusion with Unit 5. This additional context would have provided a more complete picture of the location, which is why the response is not perfect. Despite this, the response is still quite useful and directly addresses the instruction. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity.
