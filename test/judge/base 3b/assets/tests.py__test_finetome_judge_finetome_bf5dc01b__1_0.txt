1. Start by preprocessing the text: Remove any punctuation, formatting and stop words, then convert the text to lowercase.

2) Split the text into individual words or n-grams, where n is the number of words in a sequence.

3) Create a list of sources where the text could have been taken from. This can include online sources, books and other documents.

4) Compare each word or n-gram from the original text to the sources using a search algorithm. Several algorithms can be used such as Rabin-Karp or Boyer-Moore string-searching algorithm.

5) Calculate the percentage of matching words or n-grams in the text and the sources. A higher percentage indicates a higher likelihood of plagiarism.

6) Use a machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression or decision tree to determine if the text is likely to be plagiarized based on the percentage of matching words or n-grams.

7) If the algorithm determines a high likelihood of plagiarism, flag the text and provide a report detailing the sources where the text matches.

8) Review flagged texts manually to determine if they are indeed plagiarized or if they were simply using common phrases or language. This can help improve the accuracy of the algorithm over time.

9) Continue to update and improve the algorithm by incorporating additional sources, improving the search algorithms and fine-tuning the machine learning model.
