```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        next_number = fibonacci_sequence[-1] + fibonacci_sequence[-2]
        fibonacci_sequence.append(next_number)
    return fibonacci_sequence[:n]
```
You can use this function to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence by calling `generate_fibonacci(n)`, where `n` is the desired number of elements in the sequence.
