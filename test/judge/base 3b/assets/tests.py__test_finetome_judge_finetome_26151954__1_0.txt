Hall effect sensors and current transformers serve as current sensors but operate differently. Hall effect sensors detect magnetic fields generated by both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) by directing the magnetic field onto a semiconductor. They provide an absolute measurement of current and are suitable for applications requiring the sensing of both AC and DC currents.

On the other hand, current transformers rely on the induction of flux from the collapsing magnetic fields produced by AC. They are typically more effective for AC currents and may not accurately measure or detect DC currents, as their gain decreases rapidly for frequencies below a certain threshold. Current transformers offer isolation, which can be advantageous when measuring power line currents.

Another method for current sensing is using a sense resistor, which creates a voltage proportional to the current. This voltage can be measured directly, but it is not isolated, requiring additional considerations for safety and system design. Often, an accompanying circuit processes the sensed voltage, converts it to a digital signal, and then sends it across an isolation barrier, such as an opto-coupler, for further processing.
