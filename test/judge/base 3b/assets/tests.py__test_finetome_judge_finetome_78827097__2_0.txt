In one step, you can append **any character** to either `s` or `t`.\n\nReturn _the minimum number of steps to make_ `s` _and_ `t` _**anagrams** of each other._\n\nAn **anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"**lee**tco**de** \", t =  \"co**a**t**s** \"\n**Output:** 7\n**Explanation:** \n- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in  \"as \" onto s =  \"leetcode \", forming s =  \"leetcode**as** \".\n- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in  \"leede \" onto t =  \"coats \", forming t =  \"coats**leede** \".\n \"leetcodeas \" and  \"coatsleede \" are now anagrams of each other.\nWe used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n**Input:** s =  \"night \", t =  \"thing \"\n**Output:** 0\n**Explanation:** The given strings are already anagrams of each other. Thus, we do not need any further steps.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n*   `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 2 * 105`\n*   `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.\n "
