Natural selection is the process by which organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits on to their offspring. It works by acting on the variation present within a population. Individuals with traits that are better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and produce offspring, while those with less advantageous traits are less likely to do so. Over time, the frequency of these advantageous traits increases in the population, leading to adaptation to the environment.
