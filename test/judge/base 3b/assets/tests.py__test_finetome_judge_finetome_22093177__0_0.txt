Natural selection is a fundamental concept in biology that explains how populations of living organisms adapt and evolve over time. It was first proposed by Charles Darwin in his book "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how natural selection works:

1. **Variation**: A population of organisms exhibits genetic variation, meaning that individuals have different traits or characteristics. These traits can be physical, behavioral, or physiological.
2. **Heritability**: The traits are heritable, meaning they are passed down from parents to offspring through the transmission of genes.
3. **Differential reproduction**: The population is exposed to environmental pressures, such as predation, climate, or competition for resources. These pressures affect the population in different ways, leading to differential reproduction.
4. **Selection**: The environment selects for certain traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction. This means that individuals with traits that are advantageous in the current environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring.
5. **Adaptation**: Over time, the population adapts to the environment, and the frequency of the selected traits increases. This is because the beneficial traits are more likely to be passed on to future generations.
6. **Evolution**: The process of natural selection leads to the evolution of the population over time. The population becomes better suited to its environment, and this is a key driver of evolution.

Key points to note:

* **Not random**: Natural selection is not random; it is directed by the environment and the interactions between organisms and their environment.
* **Gradual**: Evolution occurs gradually, over many generations, rather than suddenly.
* **No clear-cut winners**: In natural selection, there are no clear-cut winners or losers. Instead, the environment selects for traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction.

Examples of natural selection in action:

* The peppered moth: Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the moth had a light-colored wing pattern, allowing it to blend in with lichen-covered tree bark. However, with the increase in air pollution, the trees became darker, and a genetic variation in the moth population resulted in a dark-colored wing pattern, which allowed the moths to blend in with the dark trees.
* The Galapagos finches: The finches on the Galapagos Islands have different beak shapes and sizes, which are adapted to the different food sources available on the islands. The environment selected for the beak shape and size that is best suited for the available food source.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how natural selection works!
