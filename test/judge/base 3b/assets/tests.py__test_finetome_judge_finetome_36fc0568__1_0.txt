The concept of a utility function, which represents an individual's preference over different choices, is often attributed to Jeremy Bentham, a 19th-century British philosopher and legal theorist. He introduced the idea of quantifying pleasure and pain, which laid the foundation for the utilitarian philosophy. However, the mathematical rigor behind representing preferences through functions can be traced back to Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, who contributed to set theory and the representation of order relations.

While Cantor's work provided a more formal approach, it's worth noting that ancient thinkers, like Aristotle, discussed the concept of well-being and the optimization of choices, which could be seen as precursors to the idea of representing preferences. Nonetheless, Bentham's work is more directly associated with the development of the modern utility function in economics.
