As a 22-year-old, it's great that you're thinking about your 401(k) investments. When it comes to risk, it's essential to strike a balance between potential returns and potential losses. Here's a general guideline to consider:

**Assess your risk tolerance:**

1. **Time horizon:** Since you're 22, you have a relatively long time horizon (30-40 years or more). This means you can afford to take on more risk in your investments.
2. **Financial goals:** What are your goals for your 401(k)? Are you trying to save for retirement, a down payment on a house, or a specific financial goal? This will help you determine your risk tolerance.
3. **Risk tolerance:** Consider how you feel about the possibility of losing money. Are you comfortable with the possibility of market downturns, or do you prefer more conservative investments?

**Investment options:**

1. **Conservative:** Bonds, bonds funds, or money market funds are relatively low-risk investments. They may not offer high returns, but they're stable and secure.
2. **Moderate:** Stocks, stock funds, or index funds offer a balance between potential returns and risk. They may offer higher returns than bonds, but there's still a possibility of losses.
3. **Aggressive:** Stocks, stock funds, or actively managed funds can offer higher returns, but they also come with higher risks.

**Diversification:**

To minimize risk, consider diversifying your 401(k) portfolio across different asset classes, such as:

1. Stocks (40-60%): Equities can offer higher returns over the long term, but be prepared for potential losses.
2. Bonds (20-40%): Fixed-income investments can provide stability and lower returns.
3. Alternatives (10-20%): Consider adding a small allocation to alternative investments, such as real estate or commodities, to diversify your portfolio.

**Example allocation:**

Based on your age and risk tolerance, consider the following allocation:

* Stocks (50%): Invest in a mix of domestic and international stocks.
* Bonds (30%): Choose a mix of government and corporate bonds.
* Alternatives (20%): Consider adding a small allocation to real estate or commodities.

**Remember:**

1. **Dollar-cost averaging:** Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions.
2. **Rebalance regularly:** Periodically review your portfolio and rebalance it to maintain your target allocation.
3. **Consult a professional:** If you're unsure about your risk tolerance or investment options, consider consulting a financial advisor or using a robo-advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced 401(k) portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
