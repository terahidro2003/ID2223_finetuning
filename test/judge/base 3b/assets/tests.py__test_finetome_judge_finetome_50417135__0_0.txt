Artificial selection and natural selection are both mechanisms of evolution, but they differ in the way they act upon a population.

**Natural Selection:**
Natural selection is the process by which a population adapts to its environment through the survival and reproduction of individuals with favorable traits. This occurs when a population is exposed to environmental pressures, such as predation, climate, or resource availability. The individuals with traits that provide a survival advantage are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing their advantageous traits to their offspring. Over time, this leads to the evolution of the population.

**Artificial Selection:**
Artificial selection, also known as selective breeding, is the process by which humans intentionally breed individuals with specific traits to produce offspring with desired characteristics. This can be done for various purposes, such as:

1. Improving crop yields or disease resistance in plants
2. Selecting for desirable traits in livestock, such as increased milk production or improved temperament
3. Developing new breeds of domesticated animals, like dogs or cats

In artificial selection, humans select individuals with favorable traits and breed them together to produce offspring with similar traits. This can lead to significant changes in the population over a relatively short period.

**Key differences:**

1. **Direction of selection:** Natural selection acts on the existing population, while artificial selection involves selecting individuals with specific traits and breeding them to produce offspring with those traits.
2. **Timeframe:** Artificial selection can occur over a relatively short period, often within a few generations, whereas natural selection can take thousands of generations to produce significant changes.
3. **Human intervention:** Artificial selection requires human intervention, whereas natural selection occurs without any external influence.
4. **Scope:** Artificial selection is typically limited to specific traits or characteristics, whereas natural selection acts on the entire population.

In summary, artificial selection is a human-driven process that involves selecting individuals with specific traits and breeding them to produce offspring with those traits, whereas natural selection is a natural process that occurs in response to environmental pressures.
