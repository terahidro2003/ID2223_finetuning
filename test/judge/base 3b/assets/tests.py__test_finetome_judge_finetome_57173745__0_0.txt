To determine the accuracy of the statement "The boy is holding a rake," let's analyze the given sentence step by step.

1. The sentence mentions a young boy in a red t-shirt. This information provides context about the boy's appearance and clothes.
2. The action mentioned in the sentence is "rakes leaves." This implies that the boy is engaged in an activity of raking leaves, likely for cleaning or yard maintenance purposes.
3. The word "rakes" is a verb in the present tense, indicating that the boy is currently raking leaves. It does not necessarily imply that the boy is holding a rake.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the sentence does not explicitly state that the boy is holding a rake. The word "rakes" describes the action the boy is performing, not the object he is holding.

Therefore, I would answer: "No, the sentence does not provide enough information to support the conclusion that 'The boy is holding a rake.'"
