**Circle Area Calculator**

Here's a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

# Define the radius of the circle
radius = 5

# Calculate the area of the circle
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is: {area}")
```

**Output:**
```
The area of the circle with radius 5 is: 78.53981633974483
```

This program uses the math library's pi constant and the exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the area of the circle. The result is then printed to the console.
