Here is a Python solution that uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate the number of root-to-leaf paths and their lengths in a binary tree:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pathCounts(root):
    def dfs(node, path_len):
        if not node:
            return 0, path_len
        paths, path_len = dfs(node.left, path_len + 1), path_len + 1
        paths += dfs(node.right, path_len + 1)
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return 1, path_len
        return paths, path_len

    paths, path_len = dfs(root, 1)
    output = []
    for i in range(path_len, 0, -1):
        paths_i, _ = dfs(root, i)
        output.append(f'{paths_i} $')

    return output

# Example usage
# Construct the binary tree for example 1
root1 = TreeNode(3)
root1.left = TreeNode(2)
root1.right = TreeNode(4)

# Construct the binary tree for example 2
root2 = TreeNode(10)
root2.left = TreeNode(20)
root2.right = TreeNode(30)
root2.left.left = TreeNode(40)
root2.left.right = TreeNode(60)

print(pathCounts(root1))  # Output: ['2 $', '2 $']
print(pathCounts(root2))  # Output: ['1 $', '2 $', '2 $']
```

In this code:

*   We define a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in the binary tree.
*   The `pathCounts` function takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns a list of strings, where each string represents the number of root-to-leaf paths of a certain length, followed by "$".
*   The `dfs` function is a helper function that performs a depth-first search on the binary tree, starting from the given node and recursively exploring its left and right subtrees. It returns the number of root-to-leaf paths and the path length.
*   In the `pathCounts` function, we call the `dfs` function starting from the root node with an initial path length of 1.
*   We then iterate over the possible path lengths in reverse order, calling the `dfs` function for each length and appending the result to the output list.
