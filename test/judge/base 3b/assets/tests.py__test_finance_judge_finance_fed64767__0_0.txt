The estimated elasticity of demand for credit with respect to interest rates is generally considered to be inelastic, meaning that changes in interest rates have a relatively small effect on credit demand. This is because households and businesses tend to maintain their borrowing patterns over time, even in the face of changes in interest rates.

Studies have shown that the elasticity of demand for credit with respect to interest rates is typically between 0.1 and 0.5 (e.g., Bernanke, 1995; Blume, 1983). This means that a 1% increase in interest rates is likely to result in a 0.1 to 0.5% decrease in credit demand.

There are several reasons why credit demand is inelastic to interest rates:

1. **Maturity effect**: Credit is typically borrowed for long periods of time, such as 5-10 years. As a result, interest rates have a relatively small impact on credit demand.
2. **Fixed costs**: Borrowers often face fixed costs, such as fees and upfront costs, that are not affected by interest rates.
3. **Risk aversion**: Households and businesses tend to be risk-averse, and therefore may not adjust their credit demand in response to changes in interest rates.

However, changes in interest rates can still have significant effects on credit demand, particularly for certain sub-populations. For example:

1. **Low-income households**: A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2013) found that a 1% increase in interest rates led to a 1.5% decrease in credit demand among low-income households.
2. **Small businesses**: A study by the Small Business Administration (2015) found that a 1% increase in interest rates led to a 2.5% decrease in credit demand among small businesses.
3. **Mortgage borrowers**: A study by the Federal Reserve (2018) found that a 1% increase in interest rates led to a 2.5% decrease in mortgage borrowing among households.

These studies suggest that changes in interest rates can have more significant effects on credit demand among certain sub-populations, particularly those with lower incomes, smaller credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios.
