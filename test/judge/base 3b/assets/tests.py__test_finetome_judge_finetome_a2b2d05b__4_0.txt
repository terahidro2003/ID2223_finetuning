The response provided a solution to the problem of adding two binary numbers with the specified constraints. The algorithm was described in a clear and concise manner, and the Python implementation was provided. The time complexity analysis was correct, and the space complexity analysis was also accurate. However, the response could have been more comprehensive by explaining the logic behind the addition of bits and the handling of the carry variable in more detail. Additionally, the response could have included more examples to demonstrate the algorithm's functionality. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response was mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4
