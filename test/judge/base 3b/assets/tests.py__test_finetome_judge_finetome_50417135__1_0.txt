Artificial selection is the intentional breeding of plants or animals by humans for specific desired traits. In contrast, natural selection is a natural process that occurs in nature based on environmental pressures. While both processes involve selecting for certain traits, artificial selection involves human intervention, whereas natural selection occurs without any external intervention.
