The Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL, is a mechanism used in computer languages such as Python that synchronizes the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time. It's a type of mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to execute in the interpreter at once. This lock is necessary because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe.

The GIL solves two critical problems:
1. It ensures that different threads don't access or change shared data at the same time, thus preventing data inconsistencies.
2. It also makes it easier for the interpreter to manage memory, which can be a challenge in a multithreaded environment.

However, the GIL can be a performance bottleneck in CPU-bound and multi-core programs. A Python interpreter with the GIL can't make effective use of more than one CPU core at a time. 

As for your second question, not all languages that compile to bytecode employ a mechanism similar to the GIL. Many languages, like Java, compile to bytecode and are designed with built-in thread-safety, thus negating the need for a global lock. Others, like Ruby, do have a Global Interpreter Lock. Each language has its own method of dealing with the problems that the GIL solves. 

In conclusion, the GIL is a necessary part of Python that ensures memory safety in a language that wasn't originally designed with threading in mind. It's not without its downsides, but it's a part of what makes Python, Python.
