There are several other factors that can influence the relationship between wages and inflation:

1. Productivity: If workers become more productive, they can produce more goods and services in the same amount of time, which can lead to lower costs for businesses. This can offset the impact of wage increases on prices, as businesses are able to maintain their profit margins without raising prices.

2. Demand: If demand for goods and services is weak, businesses may not be able to pass on the increased labor costs to consumers. This can limit the impact of wage increases on prices.

3. Supply: If there is excess capacity in the economy, businesses may be able to increase production without raising prices, which can help to offset the impact of wage increases on prices.

4. Exchange rates: If a country's currency appreciates relative to other currencies, the cost of imported goods may fall, which can help to offset the impact of wage increases on prices.

5. Government policy: Government policies, such as taxes and subsidies, can also influence the relationship between wages and inflation. For example, if the government provides subsidies to businesses to offset the cost of wage increases, this can help to limit the impact of wage increases on prices.

In summary, the relationship between wages and inflation is complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. While wage increases can contribute to inflation, the extent to which this occurs depends on a range of other economic factors.
