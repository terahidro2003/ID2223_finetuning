Genetic variation can occur in populations through several mechanisms, including mutation, recombination, and gene flow. Mutation is a random change in the DNA sequence of an organism's genome and can result in new traits. Recombination occurs during meiosis when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, leading to new combinations of alleles. Gene flow occurs when individuals from one population migrate to another, bringing with them new alleles that can be incorporated into the recipient population.
