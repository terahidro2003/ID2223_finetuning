To find the value of k, we can use the fact that if one root of the equation is 4, then (x-4) must be a factor of the equation.

So, we can write the equation as:

2x^2 + 3x - k = 2(x-4)(x+a) = 2x^2 + 2ax - 8x - 8a

Now, we can equate the coefficients:

2a = 3 => a = 3/2

-8a = -k => -8(3/2) = -k => -12 = -k

Now, we can solve for k:

k = 12

So, the final answer is:

\boxed{12}
