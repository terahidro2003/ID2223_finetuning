The Double Slit Experiment can be understood using introductory Quantum Mechanics principles without relying on Path Integral Formalism as follows:

**Classical Description:**
In classical physics, if you pass a beam of particles (such as electrons) through two parallel slits, you would expect to see two distinct patterns on a screen behind the slits, corresponding to the two paths the electrons took. This is because each electron would travel from one slit to the other, and the resulting interference pattern would be the superposition of the two paths.

**Quantum Description:**
However, when you conduct the Double Slit Experiment with electrons, you observe an interference pattern on the screen, but it's not the classical pattern you'd expect. Instead, the electrons create an interference pattern that resembles a diffraction pattern, similar to that produced by light passing through a single slit. This suggests that the electrons are behaving as wave-like particles, and they're not just passing through the slits one by one.

**Wave-Particle Duality:**
The Double Slit Experiment illustrates the wave-particle duality of quantum objects, such as electrons. According to this principle, particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they're observed. In this case, the electrons are behaving like waves, creating an interference pattern on the screen.

**Superposition and Entanglement:**
The Double Slit Experiment also demonstrates the principles of superposition and entanglement. The electrons are in a superposition of states, meaning they exist in multiple positions simultaneously (i.e., both slits at the same time). This superposition is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, and it's what allows the electrons to interfere with each other.

**Observer Effect:**
Finally, the Double Slit Experiment highlights the importance of the observer effect in quantum mechanics. When you observe the electrons as they pass through the slits, they suddenly "collapse" into one of the two paths, and the interference pattern disappears. This suggests that the act of observation itself can change the behavior of the electrons, which is a key aspect of quantum mechanics.

**Mathematical Representation:**
Mathematically, the Double Slit Experiment can be represented by the wave function ψ(x), which encodes the probability amplitude of finding an electron at position x. The wave function can be written as:

ψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)

where A and B are constants, k is the wave number, and x is the position. The probability density of finding an electron at position x is given by:

P(x) = |ψ(x)|^2

The probability density is a measure of the likelihood of finding an electron at that position. When you pass the electrons through the slits, the wave function becomes a superposition of the two wave functions:

ψ(x) = C sin(kx) + D cos(kx)

where C and D are constants. The resulting probability density is an interference pattern, which can be calculated using the following equation:

P(x) = |C sin(kx) + D cos(kx)|^2

This equation represents the probability of finding an electron at position x, and it's what gives rise to the interference pattern on the screen.

In summary, the Double Slit Experiment can be understood using introductory Quantum Mechanics principles as follows:

* Wave-particle duality
* Superposition and entanglement
* Observer effect
* Wave function and probability density

These principles demonstrate the fundamental nature of quantum objects and the strange implications of quantum mechanics.
