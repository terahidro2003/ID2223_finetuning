Here is a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle:

```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

# Define the radius
radius = 5

# Calculate the area
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f} square units.")
```

In this program, we use the formula for the area of a circle (A = πr²) to calculate the area, where A is the area and r is the radius. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent π, and the `** 2` operator is used to square the radius. The result is then printed to the console.

Note that the `:.2f` in the print statement is used to format the output to two decimal places.

Alternatively, you can also use a function from the math library that calculates the area directly:

```python
import math

def calculate_circle_area(radius):
    """
    Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle.
    """
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    return area

# Define the radius
radius = 5

# Calculate the area
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f} square units.")
```

Or, you can use a one-liner solution:

```python
import math

radius = 5
area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f} square units.")
```
