Here is a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence
```

Here's an explanation of how this function works:

- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list.
- If `n` is 1, the function returns a list containing only 0.
- If `n` is 2, the function returns a list containing 0 and 1, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.
- For any other value of `n`, the function initializes a list `fib_sequence` containing the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
- The function then enters a while loop that continues until `fib_sequence` contains `n` numbers.
- Inside the while loop, the function appends the sum of the last two numbers in `fib_sequence` to `fib_sequence`.
- Once the while loop completes, the function returns `fib_sequence`, which now contains the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```python
print(generate_fibonacci(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
