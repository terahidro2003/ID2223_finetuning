Here's a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number:

```python
def generate_fibonacci(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Args:
    n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
    list: A list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If n is less than 0.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")

    # Initialize the list to store the Fibonacci sequence
    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number
    while len(fibonacci_sequence) < n:
        # Calculate the next number in the sequence as the sum of the last two numbers
        next_number = fibonacci_sequence[-1] + fibonacci_sequence[-2]
        # Append the next number to the sequence
        fibonacci_sequence.append(next_number)

    return fibonacci_sequence

# Example usage:
n = 5
result = generate_fibonacci(n)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

This function starts with the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, 0 and 1. It then enters a loop where it continuously calculates the next number in the sequence by summing the last two numbers. This process continues until the sequence contains n numbers. The function returns the generated Fibonacci sequence.
