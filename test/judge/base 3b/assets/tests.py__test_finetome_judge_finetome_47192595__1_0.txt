Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) refers to the collective oscillation of free electrons at the interface between a metal and a dielectric medium, such as air or water, when excited by incident light. In the context of metal nanoparticles, this phenomenon occurs when light interacts with the particles, creating an evanescent field that extends a short distance beyond the particle's surface. This field can excite surface plasmons, leading to strong absorption or scattering of light.

One significant application of surface plasmon resonance is in sensing. Due to their high sensitivity to changes in the local environment, metal nanoparticles can be employed as highly efficient sensors. For instance, by attaching metal nanoparticles to a surface and coating them with a specific chemical or biological receptor, any molecules that bind to these receptors can alter the local refractive index. This change, in turn, affects the surface plasmon resonance and, consequently, the amount of light reflected or absorbed. As a result, even small changes in the concentration of the target molecule can be detected, making SPR-based sensors extremely sensitive for chemical, biochemical, or biological analyses.
