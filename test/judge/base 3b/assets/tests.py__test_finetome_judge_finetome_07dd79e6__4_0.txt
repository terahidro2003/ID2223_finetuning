The response provides a clear and accurate definition of an anion, explaining that it is a negatively charged ion formed when an atom or molecule gains one or more electrons. It also correctly identifies that anions are typically found in substances such as salts, bases, and minerals. The response further elaborates on the roles of anions in chemical reactions and biological processes, which adds depth to the explanation.

However, the response could have been more comprehensive by discussing the formation of anions through the loss of a proton, which is a key aspect of their formation. Additionally, the response could have provided a more detailed explanation of the attraction between anions and cations, which is crucial for understanding the structure and behavior of ionic compounds.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the response is mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity. It directly addresses the instruction with appropriate depth, making it a strong response overall.
