To graph the equation #(x^2 / 4) - (y^2 / 9) = 1#, we need to identify its standard form and recognize its type.

The equation can be rewritten as:

(x^2 / 4) - (y^2 / 9) = 1

This is the standard form of an ellipse, where the center is at the origin (0,0).

To find the major and minor axes, we need to determine the values of a, b, c, and the center (h,k).

Comparing with the standard form of an ellipse: (x-h)^2/a^2 + (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1

Here, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 9

a = 2 (since a^2 = 4)
b = 3 (since b^2 = 9)

The center (h,k) is (0,0)

Now we can identify the major and minor axes:
- Major axis: horizontal (since a is larger than b), with length 2a = 4 units
- Minor axis: vertical, with length 2b = 6 units

The equation #(x^2 / 4) - (y^2 / 9) = 1# represents an ellipse centered at the origin (0,0), with a major axis of 4 units (horizontal) and a minor axis of 6 units (vertical).
