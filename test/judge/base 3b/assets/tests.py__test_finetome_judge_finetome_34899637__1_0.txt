Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weight of the input string by finding the ASCII values of each character and summing them up. 
Step 2:  Then we need to calculate the final answer by dividing the weight by the length of the string and rounding it to the previous integer value.
Step 3:  Depending on whether the final answer is odd or even, we need to reverse the string or print the original string.
Step 4:  We'll use a loop to process each test case and perform the required calculations for each string in the loop.
```python
# Step 5:  Input the number of test cases
t = int(input())
# Step 6:  Iterate through the test cases
for i in range(0, t):
    # Step 7:  Input the string for the task
    
    s = input()
    # Step 8:  Split the string into a list of characters and reverse it
    
    l = list(s)
    l.reverse()
    # Step 9:  Initialize the weight to 0
    
    f = 0
    # Step 10:  Calculate the weight of the string by finding the ASCII value of each character and summing them up
    
    for k in range(0, len(s)):
        f = f + ord(s[k])
    # Step 11:  Divide the weight by the length of the string
    
    res = f // len(s)
    # Step 12:  Check if the final answer is odd or even
    
    if(res % 2 == 0):
        # Step 13:  Print the original string
        
        print(s)
    else:
        # Step 14:  If the final answer is odd, reverse the string
        
        out = ""
        for h in range(0, len(s)):
            out = out + l[h]
        print(out)

```
