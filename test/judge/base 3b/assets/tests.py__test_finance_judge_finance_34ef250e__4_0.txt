The response is mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity. The calculations for the revenue and cost for both large and small candles are accurate, and the final profit per day and per week is correctly calculated. However, the response could have been more comprehensive by explicitly stating the number of large candles sold per day and the number of small candles sold per day, which is a minor omission. The response also lacks a bit of clarity in the transition between the daily profit and the weekly profit calculation. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response effectively addresses the instruction and provides an accurate and helpful answer. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4
