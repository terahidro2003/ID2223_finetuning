[Reasoning]
To solve this problem, we can create a Python function that iterates through the list of words, creating n-grams of a specified size (n). For each n-gram, we check if it's already in our dictionary. If it is, we increment its frequency by 1. If it's not, we add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1. We repeat this process for all n-grams in the list.

[Implementation]
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def count_ngrams(words, n):
    """
    Counts the frequency of each n-gram in a given list of words.

    Args:
        words (list): A list of words.
        n (int): The size of the n-grams.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where the keys are the n-grams and the values are the corresponding frequencies.
    """
    ngram_freq = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(len(words) - n + 1):
        ngram = ' '.join(words[i:i+n])
        ngram_freq[ngram] += 1
    return dict(ngram_freq)
```

[Explanation]
This function uses a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create a dictionary where the default value for each key is 0. This allows us to easily keep track of the frequency of each n-gram. We iterate through the list of words, creating n-grams of size n. For each n-gram, we increment its frequency by 1.

[Tests]
You can write the following test cases to ensure it works correctly:

```python
import unittest

class TestCountNgrams(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_ngram_frequency(self):
        words = ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
        n = 2
        expected_output = {
            'the quick': 2,
            'quick brown': 1,
            'brown fox': 1,
            'fox jumps': 1,
            'jumps over': 1,
            'over the': 1,
            'the lazy': 1,
            'lazy dog': 1
        }
        self.assertEqual(count_ngrams(words, n), expected_output)

    def test_ngram_frequency_with_duplicates(self):
        words = ['the', 'the', 'quick', 'quick', 'brown', 'brown', 'fox', 'fox', 'jumps', 'jumps', 'over', 'over', 'the', 'the', 'lazy', 'lazy', 'dog', 'dog']
        n = 2
        expected_output = {
            'the the': 4,
            'the quick': 2,
            'quick brown': 2,
            'brown fox': 2,
            'fox jumps': 2,
            'jumps over': 2,
            'over the': 2,
            'the lazy': 2,
            'lazy dog': 2
        }
        self.assertEqual(count_ngrams(words, n), expected_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These test cases cover both unique and duplicate n-grams to validate the correctness of the `count_ngrams` function.
