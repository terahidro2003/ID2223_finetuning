Let's analyze the costs and revenues:

Initial investment: $250,000
Daily operational cost: 2% of $250,000 = $5,000

Daily revenue: 200 tickets/day × $15/ticket = $3,000

To break even, Alex needs to cover the initial investment and the daily operational costs. Let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = Initial investment + Daily operational cost × Number of days
= $250,000 + $5,000 × Number of days

Since Alex wants to break even, the total revenue should equal the total cost:

Total revenue = Daily revenue × Number of days
= $3,000 × Number of days

Setting the total revenue equal to the total cost:

$3,000 × Number of days = $250,000 + $5,000 × Number of days

Subtracting $5,000 × Number of days from both sides:

-$2,000 × Number of days = -$250,000

Dividing both sides by -$2,000:

Number of days = $250,000 / $2,000
= 125 days

So, it will take Alex \\boxed{125} days to break even and recover the initial investment.
