Here's a simple Java program that counts the number of vowels in a given sentence.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class VowelCounter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a sentence: ");
        String sentence = scanner.nextLine();
        int vowelCount = countVowels(sentence);
        System.out.println("Number of vowels: " + vowelCount);
    }

    /**
     * Counts the number of vowels in a sentence.
     * 
     * @param sentence the sentence to count vowels in
     * @return the number of vowels in the sentence
     */
    public static int countVowels(String sentence) {
        sentence = sentence.toLowerCase(); // convert to lowercase
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

This program works by first converting the input sentence to lowercase, then iterating over each character in the sentence. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), it increments the vowel count. The final vowel count is then printed to the console.
