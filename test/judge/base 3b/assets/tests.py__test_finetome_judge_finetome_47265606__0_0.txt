An anion is a negatively charged ion, typically formed when an atom or molecule gains one or more electrons. This gain of electrons results in a net negative charge. Anions are typically found in compounds, such as salts, where they are often combined with positively charged cations.

For example, when sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl2), it forms sodium chloride (NaCl), also known as table salt. In this compound, the sodium ion (Na+) is positively charged, and the chloride ion (Cl-) is negatively charged, making it an anion.

Other common examples of anions include:

- Carbonate (CO3^2-)
- Bicarbonate (HCO3-)
- Sulfate (SO4^2-)
- Phosphate (PO4^3-)

Anions play important roles in various biological and chemical processes, such as acid-base chemistry, cellular metabolism, and nutrient transport in the body.

It's worth noting that anions can also be found in nature, such as in seawater, where they are an essential component of the ocean's chemistry.
