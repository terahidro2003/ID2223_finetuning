The response provided a Python code that solves the problem, but it lacks the depth and clarity required to fully understand the solution. The code is correct, but it does not explain the steps involved in the solution, which is crucial for understanding the logic behind the code.

The response also fails to address the second part of the task, which is to divide the weight of the string by its length and round the result to the previous integer value. This is a significant omission, as it is a critical part of the task.

Furthermore, the response does not provide any explanation of the code, which makes it difficult for someone unfamiliar with Python to understand how the code works. The lack of explanation and the omission of the second part of the task make the response less helpful and accurate.

In conclusion, while the code is correct, the response is not as helpful or accurate as it could be due to the lack of explanation and the omission of the second part of the task. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for a score of 5.
