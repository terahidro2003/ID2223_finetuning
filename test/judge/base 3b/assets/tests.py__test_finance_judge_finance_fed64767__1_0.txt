The elasticity of demand for credit with respect to interest rates measures how sensitive credit demand is to changes in interest rates. Studies have provided various estimates:

- Gross and Souleles (2001) examined credit cards and found that a 1% increase in interest rates leads to a decrease in demand for credit by approximately 1.3%.
- Follain and Dunsky (1997) focused on mortgages and reported that the elasticity could range from -1.5 to -3.5, indicating a more significant decline in credit demand.

Two aspects to consider are:
1. Shifting borrowing between sources: An increase in one borrowing rate may cause borrowers to switch to other sources, potentially overestimating the overall debt elasticity.
2. Spending adjustments: Higher interest rates can lead to reduced spending and a shift towards cash payments, with wealthier households having the flexibility to spend less or borrow less, while poorer households may only reduce spending.

Some studies that explore these effects further include:
- Karlan, D., & Zinman, J. (2009) investigate information asymmetries in a consumer credit field experiment, detecting moral hazard and hidden information problems.
- Mandell, L. (1971) examines the effect of the Truth-in-Lending Law on consumers' interest rate awareness, analyzing subgroups based on personal characteristics.
- Calem, P. S., & Mester, L. J. (1995) provide empirical evidence on the stickiness of credit card interest rates, attributing it to search and switch costs for consumers and adverse selection for firms.
- Ausubel, L. M. (1991) discusses the lack of competition in the credit card market, offering theoretical insights and counterfactual calculations.

These studies contribute to understanding the elasticity of credit demand and its impact on different segments of the population.
