**Mathematical Expression Evaluator**

Below is a Python program that evaluates the mathematical expression `(7/2 + 3) * 5` and prints out the result.

```python
def evaluate_expression():
    """
    Evaluates the mathematical expression (7/2 + 3) * 5.
    """
    # Define the mathematical expression as a string
    expression = "(7/2 + 3) * 5"

    # Use the eval function to evaluate the expression
    # The eval function parses the expression passed to this method and executes Python expression(s) passed as a string.
    result = eval(expression)

    # Print out the result
    print("Result:", result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    evaluate_expression()
```

**Explanation**

The `evaluate_expression` function defines the mathematical expression as a string and then uses the `eval` function to evaluate it. The `eval` function parses the expression and executes it, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

**Order of Operations**

In this case, the order of operations is evaluated as follows:

1. Division: 7/2 = 3.5
2. Addition: 3.5 + 3 = 6.5
3. Multiplication: 6.5 * 5 = 32.5

Therefore, the result of the expression `(7/2 + 3) * 5` is 32.5.

**Note**

Using `eval` can pose a security risk if you're planning to execute user-supplied input, as it can evaluate any Python expression. In this case, we're assuming the input is a simple mathematical expression.
