Here are some suggestions to make the introductory set theory and predicate logic part of your "proof techniques" class more engaging and enjoyable for sophomore math majors:

1. **Use real-world examples**: Connect set theory and predicate logic to real-world applications, such as data analysis, computer science, or philosophy. This can help students see the relevance and importance of these topics.
2. **Make it interactive**: Incorporate group discussions, debates, or role-playing exercises to encourage students to think critically and work together to solve problems.
3. **Visual aids**: Utilize visual aids like diagrams, graphs, and charts to help students visualize and understand complex set theory and predicate logic concepts.
4. **Apply to familiar topics**: Use familiar topics, such as graph theory or number theory, to illustrate how set theory and predicate logic can be applied to solve problems.
5. **Incorporate puzzles and brain teasers**: Add some fun and challenging puzzles or brain teasers that require students to apply set theory and predicate logic concepts to solve.
6. **Case studies**: Present case studies of famous mathematicians or scientists who have used set theory and predicate logic to make groundbreaking discoveries.
7. **Collaborative problem-solving**: Encourage students to work in groups to solve problems, promoting teamwork and communication skills.
8. **Gamification**: Incorporate game-like elements, such as a "proof scavenger hunt" or a "set theory challenge," to make the course more engaging and fun.
9. **Real-time applications**: Explore current research and applications of set theory and predicate logic in fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science.
10. **Make it relevant to their interests**: Use the students' interests and hobbies to illustrate how set theory and predicate logic can be applied to solve problems in their desired field.

Some specific ideas for lectures or activities:

* "Set Theory in Action": Use a real-world example, such as a dataset or a computer program, to illustrate how set theory can be used to solve a problem.
* "Predicate Logic Puzzle": Provide a puzzle that requires students to use predicate logic to solve a problem, such as finding the set of all numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.
* "Graph Theory Challenge": Use graph theory to illustrate how set theory and predicate logic can be applied to solve problems, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* "Case Study: Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem": Present a case study of the famous mathematician Kurt Gödel and his work on the incompleteness of formal systems, highlighting the importance of predicate logic in understanding mathematical truths.

By incorporating these ideas, you can make the introductory set theory and predicate logic part of your "proof techniques" class more engaging, enjoyable, and relevant to the students' interests.
