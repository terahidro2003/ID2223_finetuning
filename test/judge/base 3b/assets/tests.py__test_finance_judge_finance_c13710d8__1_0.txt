The PoFC (Proof of Finance Contribution) consensus mechanism employed by the MOS project combines two distinct forms of incentive for the first time, integrating them in a weighted form. This approach enhances the flexibility and expansibility of the applications derived from the MOS project, significantly surpassing the limitations imposed by traditional reliance on work (PoW) or stake (PoS) alone. The PoFC mechanism supports a more diverse range of applications within the decentralized organization.
