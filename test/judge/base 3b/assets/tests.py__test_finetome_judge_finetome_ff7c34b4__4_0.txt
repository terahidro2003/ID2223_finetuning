The response provided is a correct implementation of the factorial function in Python. It correctly handles the base case of N being 0 or 1, and it uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number N. However, the response lacks the step-by-step explanation that would make it more helpful and clear for someone who is not familiar with recursion or Python programming. The response also does not explicitly state the constraints of the problem, which is an important aspect of the instruction. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response is mostly correct and helpful, and it directly addresses the instruction with appropriate depth. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4
