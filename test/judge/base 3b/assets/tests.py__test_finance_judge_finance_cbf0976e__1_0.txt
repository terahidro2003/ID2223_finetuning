The expansion of mobile phone usage to tens of millions of women in the developing world contributes to economic development by providing them with access to mobile services that can empower them and lift their families out of poverty. According to the GSMA, 41% of women reported having increased income and professional opportunities once they owned a mobile phone. The potential long-term effects of this expansion include poverty reduction and economic growth, as mobile phone access can lead to increased income and business opportunities, improved healthcare, and enhanced education.
