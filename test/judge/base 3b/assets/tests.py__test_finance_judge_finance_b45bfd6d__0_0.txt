To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations.

In a regular dodecahedron, there are 30 edges. We want to choose three edges such that no two of them share a common vertex. 

Let's consider the number of ways to choose the first edge. We can choose any of the 30 edges as the first edge.

For the second edge, we cannot choose the edge that shares a common vertex with the first edge. Therefore, there are 27 edges remaining to choose from for the second edge.

For the third edge, we cannot choose the edges that share a common vertex with the first two edges. Therefore, there are 24 edges remaining to choose from for the third edge.

However, this approach counts each combination multiple times. To correct for this, we need to divide by the number of ways to order the three edges, which is 3!.

The total number of ways to choose three edges is therefore:

(30 * 27 * 24) / 3! = (30 * 27 * 24) / 6 = 27 * 24 = 648

However, we have overcounted by a factor of 2 since we are choosing edges, not the order in which they appear. Therefore, we need to divide by 2.

The total number of ways to choose three edges is therefore:

648 / 2 = 324

Therefore, there are 324 ways to choose three edges in a regular dodecahedron such that no two of them share a common vertex.
