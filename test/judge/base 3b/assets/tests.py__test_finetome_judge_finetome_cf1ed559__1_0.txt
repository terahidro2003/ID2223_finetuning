The colors we perceive through the skin are not the actual colors of the arteries and veins. The blood flowing through them appears different based on its oxygen content. Arterial blood, rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, has a brighter red color. Veins, carrying deoxygenated blood, have a deeper maroon hue.

Explanation:
Veins are more superficial and thus more visible under the skin, while arteries are primarily located at deeper levels. The appearance of veins as blue under the skin is an optical illusion. Light passing through the skin is absorbed differently by red and blue wavelengths, making veins appear bluish. 

In reality, the arterial blood's bright red color is due to the presence of oxy-hemoglobin in red blood cells, while the blood in veins, having released its oxygen, appears darker due to the reduced oxygen content. For illustrative purposes, arteries are often depicted as red and veins as blue to distinguish their roles in the circulatory system.
