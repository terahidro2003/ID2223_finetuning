Since the distance from the x-axis to point P is half the distance from the y-axis to point P, let's denote the distance from the y-axis to point P as 'd'. 

Then, the distance from the x-axis to point P is d/2.

We know that the y-coordinate is -6, which is also the distance from the x-axis to point P. 

So, d/2 = -6.

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us d = -12.

The distance from the y-axis to point P is -12 units.
