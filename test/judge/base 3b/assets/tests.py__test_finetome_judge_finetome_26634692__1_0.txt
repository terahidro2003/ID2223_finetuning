Certainly! You can achieve this by writing a function that iterates through each character of both strings and checks for any differences. Here's an example code that demonstrates this:

```python
def is_same(str1, str2):
    flag = True
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            flag = False
            break
    return flag
```

This code defines a function called `is_same` that takes two string parameters, `str1` and `str2`. It initializes a boolean variable `flag` as `True`, assuming the strings are initially the same. Then, it iterates through the characters of `str1` using the `range(len(str1))` construct.

Within the loop, it compares the characters at the same position (`i`) in both strings using `str1[i] != str2[i]`. If a mismatch is found, indicating that the strings are different, the `flag` is set to `False` and the loop is exited using the `break` statement.

Finally, the `flag` value is returned, which will be `True` if all characters were the same and `False` otherwise.

You can use this `is_same` function in your code whenever you need to compare two strings and determine if they are the same.
