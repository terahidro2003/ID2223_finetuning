Convergent evolution is the process by which unrelated species evolve similar features independently in response to similar environmental pressures. These similar features may not have been present in the ancestors of the species but develop due to the shared need to adapt to similar environments. For example, birds and bats evolved wings independently to fly despite not sharing a common ancestor with wings.
