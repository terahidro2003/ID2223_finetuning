Here is a simple Python program that correctly calculates and prints the result of this mathematical expression, remembering to correctly follow the order of operations (parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction):

```python
# calculate the division operation first
div_result = 7 / 2
# add 3 to the result of the division operation
add_result = div_result + 3
# multiply the result of the addition operation by 5
final_result = add_result * 5

print(final_result)
```

Or a more concise version:

```python
# Performed all in one line.
result = ((7 / 2) + 3) * 5
print(result)
``` 

Both these Python codes first perform the division operation, then add 3 to the result, and finally multiply that sum by 5.
