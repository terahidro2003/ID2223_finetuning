To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. The sentence states that "A young boy in a red t-shirt rakes leaves." This indicates that the boy is performing the action of raking leaves.

2. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the boy is holding a rake. The word "rakes" is a verb, which means it describes the action of the boy, not the object he's holding.

3. In English, the verb form of an object (in this case, the rake) is often a noun in its singular form, which is "rake". However, in this sentence, the verb form is used, not the noun form. 

4. To be accurate, we can infer that the boy is holding a rake because the verb form "rakes" implies that the boy is using a rake to perform the action of raking leaves. 

However, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the boy is holding a rake, but we can say that the sentence implies it.
