The phrase "on the spot" is a common idiom that has a specific meaning in the context of finance and business.

"On the spot" refers to a payment or transaction that is made immediately, without delay. It means that the payment is made at the exact moment of purchase or receipt, often with the seller or service provider receiving the payment as soon as it is made.

For example, if you buy a product "on the spot," you would pay for it immediately, without waiting for any further processing or payment.

In finance, "on the spot" is often used to describe a payment method where the funds are transferred to the seller or service provider in real-time, without any delay or processing fee.
