The response provided a solution that correctly implements the modular arithmetic property to calculate the remainder of a big positive number when divided by 11. The explanation of the solution was clear and the code was well-structured and easy to understand. The time and space complexity were also correctly identified as O(n) and O(1) respectively, which aligns with the expected complexity for this problem.

However, the response could have been more comprehensive by including a step-by-step explanation of the solution, similar to the reference answer. This would have provided a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process. Additionally, the response could have been more explicit in stating that the function does not need to read input or print anything, which is a key aspect of the task.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the response was mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity. Therefore, the response is mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity.
