The theory of evolution and the concept of adaptation are closely related. Adaptation is the process by which organisms become better suited to their environment over time. The formula for adaptation states that it is a combination of variation and natural selection. This means that individuals within a population have different traits, and those with traits that are better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, the frequency of these advantageous traits increases in the population, leading to adaptation.
Evolution, on the other hand, is the process by which species change over time. The formula for evolution includes descent with modification, which means that species change as they descend from their ancestors. Modification is the result of genetic variation and natural selection, which are the same factors that contribute to adaptation.
In summary, adaptation is a process that leads to better fit between organisms and their environment, while evolution is a process that leads to the descent of species with modification over time. Both adaptation and evolution are driven by genetic variation and natural selection.
