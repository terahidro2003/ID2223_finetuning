The four main chambers of the human heart are:

1. **Right Atrium (RA)**: The right atrium is the upper right chamber of the heart. Its primary function is to receive oxygen-depleted blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava veins. The blood then flows into the right ventricle.

2. **Right Ventricle (RV)**: The right ventricle is the lower right chamber of the heart. Its main function is to pump oxygen-depleted blood from the right atrium to the lungs through the pulmonary artery.

3. **Left Atrium (LA)**: The left atrium is the upper left chamber of the heart. Its primary function is to receive oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins. The blood then flows into the left ventricle.

4. **Left Ventricle (LV)**: The left ventricle is the lower left chamber of the heart. Its main function is to pump oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium to the rest of the body through the aorta, the largest artery in the human body.

These four chambers work together to maintain the circulation of blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues and organs while removing carbon dioxide and other waste products.
