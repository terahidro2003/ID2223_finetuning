Your task is to complete the code and fix the errors to correctly estimate the value of \u03c0.\n\nThe Monte Carlo method for estimating \u03c0 involves randomly selecting points within a square and determining the ratio of points that fall within a quarter circle inscribed in the square to the total number of points. This ratio converges to \u03c0/4 as the number of points increases.\n\nThe code snippet provided attempts to implement this method, but it contains errors and is incomplete. Your task is to fix the errors, complete the code, and implement the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of \u03c0.\n\nComplete the code to:\n1. Generate random points within a square of side length 1.\n2. Determine the number of points that fall within a quarter circle inscribed in the square.\n3. Use the ratio of points within the quarter circle to the total number of points to estimate the value of \u03c0.\n4. Print the estimated value of \u03c0."
