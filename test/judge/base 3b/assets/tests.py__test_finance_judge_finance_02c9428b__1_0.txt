## Step 1: Calculate the balance after 10 years for Plan A
To calculate the balance after 10 years for Plan A, we need to use the formula for compound interest, which is given by:
\\[ A = P \\left( 1 + \\frac{r}{n} \\right)^{nt} \\]
where A is the balance, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times compounded per year, and t is the time in years.
For Plan A, the principal is $\\$20{,}000$, the annual interest rate is $8\\%$, the interest is compounded semiannually, and the time is 10 years.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\\[ A = 20000 \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.08}{2} \\right)^{2*10} \\]
\\[ A = 20000 \\left( 1 + 0.04 \\right)^{20} \\]
\\[ A = 20000 \\left( 1.04 \\right)^{20} \\]
\\[ A = 20000 * 2.191123 \\]
\\[ A = 43822.46 \\]

## Step 2: Calculate the balance after 15 years for Plan A
Now, let's calculate the balance after 15 years for Plan A.
After 10 years, Emily withdraws one-third of her balance, which is $\\frac{1}{3} * 43822.46 = 14607.49$. The remaining balance is $43822.46 - 14607.49 = 29214.97$.
The remaining balance of $29214.97$ is compounded for another 5 years.
Using the compound interest formula again, we get:
\\[ A = 29214.97 \\left( 1 + \\frac{0.08}{2} \\right)^{2*5} \\]
\\[ A = 29214.97 \\left( 1 + 0.04 \\right)^{10} \\]
\\[ A = 29214.97 \\left( 1.04 \\right)^{10} \\]
\\[ A = 29214.97 * 1.480244 \\]
\\[ A = 43251.91 \\]

## Step 3: Calculate the total withdrawals for Plan A
The total withdrawals for Plan A are the sum of the withdrawal after 10 years and the withdrawal after 15 years.
Total withdrawals for Plan A = $14607.49 + 43251.91 = 57859.40$

## Step 4: Calculate the balance after 15 years for Plan B
For Plan B, the principal is $\\$20{,}000$, the annual interest rate is $8\\%$, the interest is compounded annually, and the time is 15 years.
Using the compound interest formula, we get:
\\[ A = 20000 \\left( 1 + 0.08 \\right)^{15} \\]
\\[ A = 20000 \\left( 1.08 \\right)^{15} \\]
\\[ A = 20000 * 3.172169 \\]
\\[ A = 63443.38 \\]

## Step 5: Calculate the difference between the total withdrawals for Plan A and Plan B
The difference between the total withdrawals for Plan A and Plan B is:
Difference = Total withdrawals for Plan B - Total withdrawals for Plan A
Difference = $63443.38 - 57859.40 = 5583.98$

## Step 6: Round the difference to the nearest dollar
Rounded difference = $5584$

The final answer is: $\\boxed{5584}$
