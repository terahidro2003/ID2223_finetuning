To assess whether you made a mistake moving jobs, let's break down the key factors involved.

**Salary:** You've gained £3.5k per annum, which is a significant increase. However, this increase comes with a 9% salary sacrifice, which reduces your take-home pay.

**Pensions:** You've switched from a 5% employer's pension to a 21% employee's pension. This is a substantial difference, but it's essential to consider the total pension contributions and the overall pension value.

**Other benefits:** You now have public transport and free parking, which can save you money on transportation costs.

**Take-home pay:** You mentioned potential student loans and other expenses. These factors will impact your take-home pay, but the exact amount depends on your individual circumstances.

To make a more informed decision, let's consider a few scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1:** You assume the 9% salary sacrifice will reduce your take-home pay by 10% (£3.5k / £35k). In this case, your take-home pay might be £31.5k, which is lower than your original salary.
2. **Scenario 2:** You consider the increased pension contributions. Assuming the 21% employee's pension is equivalent to a 10% increase in your salary, this could potentially offset the 9% salary sacrifice.

To determine whether you made a mistake, consider the following:

* Are your salary and pension goals still aligned with your original job?
* Do you have a clear understanding of your financial situation, including your student loans and other expenses?
* Are there other benefits or perks in your new job that make up for the reduced take-home pay?

It's also essential to consider your personal priorities and values. Do you value the sense of fulfillment and purpose that comes with working in the NHS, or do you prioritize your financial goals?

Ultimately, whether you made a mistake moving jobs depends on your individual circumstances and priorities. It's recommended that you:

* Review your budget and financial situation to understand the impact of the salary sacrifice and pension contributions.
* Consider consulting a financial advisor to get personalized advice.
* Weigh your priorities and make a decision that aligns with your values and goals.

Remember, it's not always about the money; it's about finding a job that makes you happy and fulfilled.
