The response provided is identical to the instruction given. It does not offer any additional information or clarification, nor does it provide any insight into the financial context of the question. The response simply repeats the instruction verbatim, which does not contribute to a helpful or accurate answer. It fails to address the instruction in any meaningful way, and therefore does not meet the criteria for a helpful, accurate, or appropriate response. The lack of depth, clarity, or any additional information makes the response inadequate for the given financial/instructional context. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1
