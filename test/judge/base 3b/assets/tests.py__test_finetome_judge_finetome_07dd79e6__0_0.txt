An anion is a negatively charged ion. It is a molecule or atom that has gained one or more electrons, resulting in a net negative charge. Anions are typically formed when a molecule or atom loses a proton or when it gains additional electrons.

In chemistry, anions are often represented by a negative sign (-) attached to the symbol of the element or molecule. For example, the chloride ion (Cl-) is a common anion.

Anions can be found in many different substances, including:

* Salts: Many salts, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), are composed of positively charged cations (Na+) and negatively charged anions (Cl-).
* Bases: Some bases, such as hydroxide ions (OH-), are composed of anions.
* Minerals: Some minerals, such as carbonate ions (CO32-), are composed of anions.

Anions play important roles in many chemical reactions and biological processes, including:

* Acid-base chemistry: Anions can react with bases to form salts and water.
* Electrolysis: Anions can conduct electricity and are often used in electrochemical reactions.
* Biological processes: Anions can participate in various biological processes, such as pH regulation and nutrient transport.

Overall, anions are an important class of ions that play key roles in many areas of chemistry and biology.
