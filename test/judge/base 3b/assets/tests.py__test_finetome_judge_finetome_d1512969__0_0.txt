Here's the Python code that solves the problem:

```python
def calculate_weight(s):
    """Calculate the weight of the string."""
    return sum(ord(c) for c in s)

def reverse_string(s):
    """Reverse the input string."""
    return s[::-1]

def solve_problem(s):
    """Solve the problem based on the parity of the weight."""
    weight = calculate_weight(s)
    length = len(s)
    if weight % 2 != 0:
        return reverse_string(s)
    else:
        return s

def main():
    """Main function."""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        result = solve_problem(s)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines three functions: `calculate_weight`, `reverse_string`, and `solve_problem`. The `calculate_weight` function calculates the weight of the string by summing up the ASCII values of its characters. The `reverse_string` function reverses the input string using slicing. The `solve_problem` function solves the problem based on the parity of the weight. If the weight is odd, it reverses the string; otherwise, it returns the original string.

The `main` function reads the number of test cases, loops through each test case, and calls the `solve_problem` function to get the result. The result is then printed to the console.

You can run this code to get the output for the given input.
