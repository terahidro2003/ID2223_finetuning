Here is the extracted personally identifiable information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "customer_id": "X-869441-W",
  "employee_id": "EMP759818",
  "customer_email": "kwheeler@example.com",
  "employee_date_of_birth": "20.01.1977"
}
```

Note: I did not include the date in the JSON output as it is not a personally identifiable piece of information. The date of birth was provided by the employee, not the customer, and was corrected upon review.
