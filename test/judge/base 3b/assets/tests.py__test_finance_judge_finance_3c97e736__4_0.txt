The response provided a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, which is helpful and accurate. However, there are minor inaccuracies in the calculations. For example, in the fifth year, the interest rate is 10% and the total amount should be $668.141232 + $60.740112 = $728.8813432, not $668.141232 + $60.740112 = $708.8813432. Similarly, in the sixth year, the total amount should be $748.07276544 + $80.15065344 = $828.223018636, not $748.07276544 + $80.15065344 = $808.223018636. These errors do not significantly affect the final answer, but they do indicate a lack of depth in the calculations. The response is mostly correct and helpful, but there is room for improvement in completeness and clarity. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4
