Anti-rival goods are goods that become more valuable as more people consume them. The example of language is a great illustration of this concept. As more people speak a particular language, it becomes more valuable and useful to each individual, as they can communicate with a larger number of people. This concept challenges traditional notions of rivalry in economics, as it suggests that some goods can exhibit positive network effects, where the value of the good increases with the number of users. This is in contrast to traditional rival goods, where the value decreases with additional users.
