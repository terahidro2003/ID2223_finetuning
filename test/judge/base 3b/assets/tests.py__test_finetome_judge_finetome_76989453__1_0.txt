Ultraviolet (UV) light does not pass through most types of glass because the energy of its photons falls within the energy band gap of the glass. The band gap is a range in energy where no electronic states can exist, and it is approximately 5 electron volts (eV) for standard glass. This energy level corresponds to the frequencies of UV light. When a photon's energy is less than the band gap, it lacks the necessary energy to excite the valence electrons in the glass atoms to higher, unoccupied energy states. As a result, the UV light is absorbed rather than transmitted.

The transparency of a material to electromagnetic waves, including visible light and UV, depends on its electronic structure and the size of its band gap. Different types of glass have varying band gaps. For instance, quartz glass has a larger band gap compared to lime glass and borosilicate glass, which is why quartz is more transparent to UV light than the others. Other factors, such as the arrangement and types of atoms in the material, can also influence transparency at specific frequencies.
