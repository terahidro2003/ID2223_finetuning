The response correctly identifies the relationship between the distances from the x-axis and the y-axis to point P. It also correctly calculates the distance from the y-axis to point P as 12 units. However, the response could have been more explicit in explaining why the absolute value of the y-coordinate is used to find the distance from the x-axis. Additionally, the response could have been clearer in explaining the process of solving the equation. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response is mostly correct and helpful, with minor room for improvement in completeness or clarity. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4
