**Plagiarism Detection Algorithm**

**Overview**

This algorithm uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect plagiarism in a document. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Preprocess the input document by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing the text into individual words.
2. **Similarity Measurement**: Calculate the similarity between the input document and a database of known texts using a metric such as Levenshtein distance or Jaccard similarity.
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Extract keywords from the input document using a technique such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. **Plagiarism Detection**: Compare the extracted keywords with the keywords from the database of known texts to detect potential plagiarism.
5. **Verification**: Verify the detected plagiarism by comparing the similarity between the input document and the known text.

**Algorithm**

### Text Preprocessing

* Remove punctuation from the input document using regular expressions.
* Convert the text to lowercase using the `lower()` function.
* Tokenize the text into individual words using the `word_tokenize()` function from the NLTK library.

### Similarity Measurement

* Use the Levenshtein distance algorithm to calculate the similarity between the input document and a database of known texts.
* The Levenshtein distance is calculated as the number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

### Keyword Extraction

* Use the TF-IDF algorithm to extract keywords from the input document.
* The TF-IDF algorithm calculates the importance of each word in the document based on its frequency and rarity in the document and the entire corpus.

### Plagiarism Detection

* Compare the extracted keywords with the keywords from the database of known texts to detect potential plagiarism.
* Use a threshold value to determine whether a match is significant enough to be considered plagiarism.

### Verification

* Verify the detected plagiarism by comparing the similarity between the input document and the known text.
* Use a confidence interval to determine the likelihood of the detected plagiarism.

**Example Implementation**

The following Python code implements the plagiarism detection algorithm using the NLTK library and the Levenshtein distance algorithm:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
from collections import Counter
import numpy as np

def levenshtein_distance(s1, s2):
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = np.zeros((m+1, n+1))

    for i in range(m+1):
        dp[i, 0] = i
    for j in range(n+1):
        dp[0, j] = j

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            cost = 0 if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1] else 1
            dp[i, j] = min(dp[i-1, j] + 1, dp[i, j-1] + 1, dp[i-1, j-1] + cost)

    return dp[m, n]

def plagiarism_detection(text, known_texts):
    # Preprocess the text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')]

    # Calculate the similarity
    similarity = levenshtein_distance(text, known_texts[0])

    # Extract keywords
    keyword_extractor = WordNetLemmatizer()
    keywords = []
    for token in tokens:
        lemmatized_token = keyword_extractor.lemmatize(token)
        if lemmatized_token not in keywords:
            keywords.append(lemmatized_token)

    # Compare keywords
    for known_text in known_texts:
        known_keywords = []
        for token in word_tokenize(known_text):
            lemmatized_token = keyword_extractor.lemmatize(token)
            if lemmatized_token not in known_keywords:
                known_keywords.append(lemmatized_token)

        similarity = levenshtein_distance(' '.join(keywords), ' '.join(known_keywords))
        if similarity < 0.5:
            return True

    return False

# Test the function
text = "This is a test document."
known_texts = ["This is a known document.", "This is another known document."]
print(plagiarism_detection(text, known_texts))
```

**Note**

This algorithm is not foolproof and can be improved by using more advanced techniques such as deep learning models and more sophisticated keyword extraction methods. Additionally, the algorithm can be modified to detect plagiarism in different types of documents, such as images or audio files.
