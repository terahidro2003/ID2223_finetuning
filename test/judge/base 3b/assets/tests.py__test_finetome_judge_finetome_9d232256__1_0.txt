Superconducting magnets indeed play a crucial role in maintaining energy efficiency in hadron accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Although they do not directly prevent energy loss from the accelerated particles, they do minimize energy dissipation within the magnet system itself. 

When hadrons are accelerated and steered around bends, they can lose energy due to synchrotron radiation, which is a result of the acceleration and not the magnet technology. The higher the magnetic field, the more energy is lost through this process, and superconducting magnets can generate stronger fields compared to conventional magnets.

The main way superconducting magnets contribute to energy efficiency is by reducing the energy lost within the accelerator infrastructure. As they operate at extremely low temperatures, superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance, allowing electric current to flow without generating heat (I*R losses) that would be present in conventional copper wire magnets. By eliminating this energy loss, superconducting magnets ensure that the majority of the energy supplied to the accelerator is used for accelerating particles, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the system.
