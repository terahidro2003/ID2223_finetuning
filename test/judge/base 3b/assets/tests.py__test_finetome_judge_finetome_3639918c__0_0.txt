To solve the problem, we will use the given root to find the value of k.

The given equation is: 2x^2 + 3x - k = 0

We know that one root of the equation is 4. We can substitute x = 4 into the equation and solve for k.

2(4)^2 + 3(4) - k = 0
2(16) + 12 - k = 0
32 + 12 - k = 0
44 - k = 0

Now, we can solve for k by isolating it on one side of the equation.

k = 44

So, the value of k is 44.

\boxed{44}
