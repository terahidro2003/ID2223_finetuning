**Mathematical Expression Evaluator**

Here's a Python program that evaluates the mathematical expression `(7/2 + 3) * 5` and prints the result. This program uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the expression.

```python
def evaluate_expression():
    """
    Evaluates the mathematical expression (7/2 + 3) * 5 and prints the result.
    """
    expression = "(7/2 + 3) * 5"
    try:
        # Evaluate the expression using eval()
        result = eval(expression)
        print(f"The result of the expression is: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to evaluate the expression
evaluate_expression()
```

However, the `eval()` function is not recommended for user-supplied input, as it can pose a security risk. If you're dealing with user-supplied input, consider using a safer alternative like `ast` or `numexpr`.

**Using the `ast` Module**

Here's a version of the program that uses the `ast` module to evaluate the expression.

```python
import ast

def evaluate_expression():
    """
    Evaluates the mathematical expression (7/2 + 3) * 5 and prints the result.
    """
    expression = "(7/2 + 3) * 5"
    try:
        # Parse the expression into an abstract syntax tree
        tree = ast.parse(expression)
        
        # Evaluate the expression using the abstract syntax tree
        result = ast.literal_eval(str(tree))
        print(f"The result of the expression is: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to evaluate the expression
evaluate_expression()
```

**Using the `numexpr` Library**

Here's a version of the program that uses the `numexpr` library to evaluate the expression.

```python
import numexpr as ne

def evaluate_expression():
    """
    Evaluates the mathematical expression (7/2 + 3) * 5 and prints the result.
    """
    expression = "(7/2 + 3) * 5"
    try:
        # Evaluate the expression using numexpr
        result = ne.evaluate(expression)
        print(f"The result of the expression is: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to evaluate the expression
evaluate_expression()
```

Note that the `numexpr` library is not included in Python's standard library, so you'll need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install numexpr
```
