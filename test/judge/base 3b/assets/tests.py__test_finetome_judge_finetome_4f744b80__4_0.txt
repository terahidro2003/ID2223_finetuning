The response provided a Python solution to the task, which is a good start. However, it lacks the depth and clarity required to fully address the instruction. The code uses dynamic programming to compute the minimum number of moves for each prefix of the sequence, which is a correct approach. However, the explanation of the code is not as clear as it could be, and the code does not handle the limitations of large input sizes.

The response also fails to provide a clear step-by-step explanation of the solution, which is crucial for understanding the logic behind the code. Additionally, the response does not mention the importance of the order of the sequence and the distribution of values, which are key factors in determining the minimum number of moves required.

The response does not fully address the instruction, as it does not provide a comprehensive solution that includes handling the limitations of large input sizes and explaining the logic behind the code. Therefore, the response is partially correct but lacks depth, clarity, and has minor inaccuracies.
