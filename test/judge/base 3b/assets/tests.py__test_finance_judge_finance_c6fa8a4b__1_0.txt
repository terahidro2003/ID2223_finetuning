Micro-credit is a financial innovation that provides small, uncollateralized loans to low-income individuals, typically in developing countries, to help them start or expand small businesses. It differs from traditional banking systems in several ways: (1) no collateral is required, (2) loan amounts are small, (3) interest rates are often lower, and (4) repayment terms are flexible. Micro-credit institutions, like the Grameen Bank, focus on lending to the poorest of the poor, whereas traditional banks typically serve more affluent customers.
