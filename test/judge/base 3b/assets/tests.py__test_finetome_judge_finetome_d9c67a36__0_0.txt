Here's a simple Java program that counts the number of vowels in a given sentence.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class VowelCounter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a sentence: ");
        String sentence = scanner.nextLine();
        int vowelCount = countVowels(sentence);
        System.out.println("Number of vowels in the sentence: " + vowelCount);
    }

    /**
     * This method counts the number of vowels in a given sentence.
     * 
     * @param sentence The input sentence.
     * @return The number of vowels in the sentence.
     */
    public static int countVowels(String sentence) {
        int vowelCount = 0;
        for (char c : sentence.toLowerCase().toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                vowelCount++;
            }
        }
        return vowelCount;
    }
}
```

### How it works:

1. The program asks the user to input a sentence using `Scanner`.
2. The `countVowels` method takes the input sentence, converts it to lowercase, and iterates over each character.
3. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), the `vowelCount` is incremented.
4. The final vowel count is printed out.

### Example use case:

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence. After you enter a sentence, it will print out the number of vowels in that sentence.

### Note:

This program counts only the standard English vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and does not account for accented vowels or other special characters.
