The response provided does not address the instruction at all. It fails to provide any information about a hometown, which was the main point of the instruction. Instead, it asks for more context, which does not help the user who is seeking information. This lack of helpfulness and accuracy makes the response inappropriate for the given instructional context. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is completely incorrect and irrelevant to the instruction. 
[RESULT] 1
