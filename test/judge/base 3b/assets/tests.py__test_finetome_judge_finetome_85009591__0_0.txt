The shape of the solar nebula, a cloud of gas and dust from which the solar system formed, played a significant role in shaping the orbits of the planets. The solar nebula was not a perfect sphere, but rather an elongated, flattened disk. This asymmetrical shape had several effects on the formation and orbits of the planets:

1. **Planetary migration**: The solar nebula's disk shape allowed for the gravitational influence of the Sun and other planets to be more pronounced in certain regions. This led to the migration of planets towards the Sun, where the gravitational force was stronger. This process, known as planetary migration, helped to concentrate the planets in the inner solar system, particularly in the region now occupied by Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
2. **Orbital eccentricity**: The solar nebula's disk shape also influenced the orbital eccentricity (ellipticity) of the planets. Planets that formed closer to the Sun and in the inner disk region tended to have more circular orbits, while those that formed farther out in the disk had more eccentric orbits. This is because the gravitational influence of the Sun and other planets was stronger near the Sun, causing the orbits to become more circular.
3. **Planetary clustering**: The solar nebula's disk shape led to the clustering of planets in the inner solar system. This clustering is thought to have occurred because planets that formed in the same region of the disk interacted with each other through gravitational forces, leading to the formation of a stable configuration. The planets in this region, including Earth and Mars, are now aligned in a nearly coplanar orbit around the Sun.
4. **Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud formation**: The solar nebula's disk shape also influenced the formation of the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, two regions of icy bodies and comets that surround the solar system. These regions are thought to have formed in the outer disk region, where the gravitational influence of the Sun was weaker. The Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud are now located at a distance of about 30-50 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and their orbits are influenced by the gravitational forces of the giant planets.
5. **Gravitational resonance**: The solar nebula's disk shape also led to the formation of gravitational resonance between planets and other objects in the solar system. This resonance occurs when the orbital periods of two objects are related by a simple ratio, such as 1:2 or 3:2. The gravitational resonance between the Earth and the Moon, for example, is thought to have played a role in stabilizing the Moon's orbit.

In summary, the shape of the solar nebula, particularly its disk shape, had a profound impact on the formation and orbits of the planets in our solar system. The gravitational forces and interactions between the planets and the Sun influenced the migration, orbital eccentricity, and clustering of the planets, ultimately shaping the solar system into its current configuration.
