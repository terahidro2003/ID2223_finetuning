To achieve this, you can use a for loop in Python. The for loop allows you to iterate over each element in the given list and perform a specific action on each element. In this case, we want to print each element in a new line.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the solution in Python:

```python
# Define a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Iterate over each element in the list
for item in my_list:
    # Print each element in a new line
    print(item)
```

In this example, we have a list called `my_list` containing elements [1, 2, 3, 4]. The for loop iterates over each element in the list, and the `item` variable represents the current element being iterated. Inside the loop, we use the `print()` function to display each element in a new line.

By running this script, you will see the output printed as follows:

```
1
2
3
4
```

Feel free to replace the `my_list` variable with your desired list to print its elements in a new line.
