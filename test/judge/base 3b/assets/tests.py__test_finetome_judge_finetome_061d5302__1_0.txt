```python
import random
import math
import stdio

# Initialize variables
num_points = 1000000  # Number of random points to generate
points_inside_circle = 0

# Generate random points and count the number of points inside the quarter circle
for _ in range(num_points):
    x = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Generate random x-coordinate
    y = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Generate random y-coordinate
    if x*x + y*y <= 1.0:  # Check if the point is inside the quarter circle
        points_inside_circle += 1

# Estimate the value of π
estimated_pi = 4 * points_inside_circle / num_points

# Print the estimated value of π
stdio.writeln("Estimated value of π: " + str(estimated_pi))
```

This solution completes the code snippet by generating random points within the square, counting the number of points inside the quarter circle, and using the ratio of points to estimate the value of π. The estimated value of π is then printed to the console.
