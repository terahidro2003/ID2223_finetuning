Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the modulo of the large positive number x when divided by 11.
Step 2:  We can convert the string representation of x to an integer and then calculate the modulo using the % operator.
Step 3:  The expected output for the function is an integer representing the value of x % 11.
```python
# Step 4: 
class Solution:

    # Step 5:  Define a function to calculate the value of x % 11 for a given big positive number x represented as a string.
    
    def xmod11(self, x):
        # Step 6:  Convert the string representation of x to an integer.
        
        A = int(x)
        # Step 7:  Calculate the modulo of the integer A when divided by 11.
        
        return A % 11
