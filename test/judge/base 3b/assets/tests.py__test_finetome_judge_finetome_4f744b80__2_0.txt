The rules of the game are fairly simple and are described below.\n\nThe playing field is a sequence of n non-negative integers ai numbered from 1 to n. The goal of the game is to make numbers a1, a2, ..., ak (i.e. some prefix of the sequence) equal to zero for some fixed k (k < n), and this should be done in the smallest possible number of moves.\n\nOne move is choosing an integer i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) such that ai > 0 and an integer t (t \u2265 0) such that i + 2t \u2264 n. After the values of i and t have been selected, the value of ai is decreased by 1, and the value of ai + 2t is increased by 1. For example, let n = 4 and a = (1, 0, 1, 2), then it is possible to make move i = 3, t = 0 and get a = (1, 0, 0, 3) or to make move i = 1, t = 1 and get a = (0, 0, 2, 2) (the only possible other move is i = 1, t = 0).\n\nYou are given n and the initial sequence ai. The task is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the first k elements of the original sequence equal to zero for each possible k (1 \u2264 k < n).\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 104), separated by single spaces.\n\nThe input limitations for getting 20 points are: \n\n  * 1 \u2264 n \u2264 300\n\n\n\nThe input limitations for getting 50 points are: \n\n  * 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000\n\n\n\nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are: \n\n  * 1 \u2264 n \u2264 105\n\nOutput\n\nPrint exactly n - 1 lines: the k-th output line must contain the minimum number of moves needed to make the first k elements of the original sequence ai equal to zero.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams, or the %I64d specifier.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n4\n1 0 1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n1\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n3\n6\n10\n16\n24\n40"
