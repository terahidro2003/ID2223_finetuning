To find the profit per day, we need to calculate the revenue and cost for both large and small candles.

Large candles:
- Number of large candles sold per day: 3
- Revenue per large candle: $15
- Cost per large candle: $8
- Revenue per day: 3 * $15 = $45
- Cost per day: 3 * $8 = $24
- Profit per day on large candles: $45 - $24 = $21

Small candles:
- Number of small candles sold per day: 8 - 3 = 5
- Revenue per small candle: $8
- Cost per small candle: $4
- Revenue per day: 5 * $8 = $40
- Cost per day: 5 * $4 = $20
- Profit per day on small candles: $40 - $20 = $20

Total profit per day: $21 + $20 = $41
Total profit per 7-day week: $41 * 7 = $287

Maya makes a profit of $287 per 7-day week.
