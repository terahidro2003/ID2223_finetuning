We can compute this by taking the determinant of the matrix:\\n\\\\[\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{i} & \\\\mathbf{j} & \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\\\\\ 5 - (-2) & \\\\pi - (-2) & X - 7 \\\\\\\\ -2 - (-3) & -2 - 10 & 7 - 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}.\\\\]\\nExpanding the determinant, we have:\\n\\\\[\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf{i} & \\\\mathbf{j} & \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\\\\\ 7 & \\\\pi + 2 & X - 7 \\\\\\\\ 1 & -12 & 6 \\\\end{pmatrix}.\\\\]\\nUsing the cofactor expansion along the first row, we get:\\n\\\\[(\\\\mathbf{b} - \\\\mathbf{c}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{c} - \\\\mathbf{a}) = \\\\mathbf{i}(-12(X-7) - (-12)(\\\\pi + 2)) - \\\\mathbf{j}(6(X-7) - (\\\\pi + 2)) + \\\\mathbf{k}(6(\\\\pi + 2) - (-12)).\\\\]\\nSimplifying, we find:\\n\\\\[(\\\\mathbf{b} - \\\\mathbf{c}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{c} - \\\\mathbf{a}) = -12 \\\\mathbf{i} - 6 \\\\mathbf{j} + 18 \\\\mathbf{k}.\\\\]\\nNow, let's compute $\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b}$. We have:\\n\\\\[\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\\\\\ 10 \\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} - \\\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\\\\\ \\\\pi \\\\\\\\ X \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -3 - 5 \\\\\\\\ 10 - \\\\pi \\\\\\\\ 1 - X \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\\\\\ 10 - \\\\pi \\\\\\\\ 1 - X \\\\end{pmatrix}.\\\\]\\nFinally, we compute the dot product $(\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b}) \\\\cdot [(\\\\mathbf{b} - \\\\mathbf{c}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{c} - \\\\mathbf{a})]$. We have:\\n\\\\[(\\\\mathbf{a} - \\\\mathbf{b}) \\\\cdot [(\\\\mathbf{b} - \\\\mathbf{c}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{c} - \\\\mathbf{a})] = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\\\\\\\ 10 - \\\\pi \\\\\\\\ 1 - X \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot (-12 \\\\mathbf{i} - 6 \\\\mathbf{j} + 18 \\\\mathbf{k}).\\\\]\\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\\n\\\\[-8(-12) + (10 - \\\\pi)(-6) + (1 - X)(18).\\\\]\\nSimplifying, we find:\\n\\\\[96 - 60 + 6 \\\\pi + 18 - 18X = 114 - 18X + 6 \\\\pi.\\\\]\\nGiven that the value of the expression is 0, we can write:\\n\\\\[114 - 18X + 6 \\\\pi = 0.\\\\]\\nTo determine the value of $X$, we need to know the value of $\\\\pi$. However, the value of $\\\\pi$ is not provided in the question, so we cannot determine the value of $X$ without additional information.\\nThe answer is: 0<|eot_id|>\""
